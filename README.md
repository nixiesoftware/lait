# lait

Track work at typing speed, onboard a teammate with one link, and let your
coding agents work the board like anyone else — no server, no signup, no
browser tab. If `cd` gets you into the project, you're already in.

```console
$ cd my-project
$ lait init

$ lait new "fix login race" --start  # file the issue, take it, branch it
MP-1  fix login race  in_progress  · you
switched to new branch 'mp-1-fix-login-race'

# ...write the fix, commit...

$ lait done                          # the branch tells lait which issue
MP-1  fix login race  done
```

- **Instant** // your issues live beside your code and open in milliseconds —
  faster than a browser tab, on a plane, in a basement
- **One-link teams** // send an invite over any chat; `join` does the rest —
  no accounts, no admin console, no seat licenses
- **Agent-native** // AI agents are first-class members: they claim, comment,
  and close issues through MCP with the same audit trail as a human
- **Branch-native** // `lait start` cuts the branch; `done`, `comment`, and
  `show` read the issue off the branch you're on
- **Private by default** // everything is end-to-end encrypted between members;
  there is no server to trust because there is no server
- **Works everywhere** // one self-contained binary for macOS, Linux, and
  Windows; offline-first, syncs whenever teammates are online together

Whether you're solo in a side project, working with a team, or
wiring up agents that need a shared board, the whole product is the one binary
below.

## Install

`lait` is a single self-contained binary, built for **macOS, Linux, and Windows**
(arm64 + x86_64) and published as a GitHub Release on every tag. Pick a channel —
they all land the same `lait`. Full matrix + verification in
[`docs/INSTALL.md`](docs/INSTALL.md).

```bash
# macOS / Linux — shell installer (places lait in ~/.cargo/bin)
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -LsSf https://github.com/Nixie-Tech-LLC/lait/releases/latest/download/lait-installer.sh | sh

# Homebrew (macOS / Linux)
brew install nixie-tech-llc/tap/lait

# prebuilt binary via Cargo, no compile
cargo binstall lait

# from source (Rust 1.91+)
cargo install lait --locked
```

```powershell
# Windows — PowerShell installer
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -c "irm https://github.com/Nixie-Tech-LLC/lait/releases/latest/download/lait-installer.ps1 | iex"
# …or:  scoop install lait   ·   winget install NixieTechLLC.Lait
```

Upgrade any install in place with `lait update` — a native self-updater that pulls
the latest release and swaps the binary (stopping a running daemon first). Shell
completions and a man page come from the binary itself
(`lait completions <shell>`, `lait man`). For an always-on **seed node**, see the
[Docker setup](docker-compose.yml).

### Nightly / dev builds

Every merge to `main` publishes prebuilt binaries to a rolling **[`dev`
prerelease](https://github.com/Nixie-Tech-LLC/lait/releases/tag/dev)** (Linux x64,
macOS arm64/x64, Windows x64) — bleeding edge, for dogfooding the latest `main`.
It's a GitHub *prerelease*, so it never shows as "Latest" and never touches the
package managers or crates.io.

```bash
# grab the current dev build for your platform
gh release download dev -R Nixie-Tech-LLC/lait
```

A dev binary reports its commit so it's unmistakable from a tagged release:
`lait --version` → `lait <version>-dev+<sha> (<date>)`.

### Build from source

```bash
cargo build --release          # Rust 1.91+ (floor driven by iroh 1.0.0-rc.1)
```

Contributing? Enable the hooks once per clone
(`git config core.hooksPath .githooks`) so fmt issues never reach CI.

## Use it like this

Every transcript below is real output from the shipped binary.

### 1 · Solo: track a repo's work without leaving it

The project directory is found by walking up from wherever you stand. `lait init`
sets up a first **project** (the issue prefix, like `MP-1`, `MP-2`…) named
after your directory, so there's nothing to configure before the first issue:

```console
$ cd my-project
$ lait init
founded space 'my-project' (ws_01JTHLH8QT…)
project: my-project (MP) — `lait new "..."` files into it

$ lait new "flaky websocket reconnect" -P high    # -P = priority
MP-1
```

From there, three views: bare `lait` is your **focus** (unread inbox + what
you're working on, in under 50 ms), `lait board` prints the columns, and
`lait serve` opens your spaces in a browser — every space on this machine, live.
Nothing needs the network; teammates come later (scenario 2) or never.

### 2 · Two of you: onboarding is one link

Invites are bearer links carrying everything a joiner needs (the space, the
trust root, a single-use auto-admit pass). Send one over any private channel;
`join` creates their store, admits them, and verifies the whole handshake:

```console
you$ lait invite                # → lait://join/… (+ QR, copied to clipboard)

them$ cd their-checkout && lait join <link> --nick bob
joining alice's space with an invite pass — you should be admitted automatically…
✔ space       ws_01JTHHNM05… ('acme')
✔ daemon      online
✔ membership  member
✔ peer        1 peer online
✔ synced      1 project(s), 2 issue(s)
you're in — get to work.
```

Everything is end-to-end encrypted; membership is a signed key graph, so
`lait members remove bob` rotates the key and revokes future reads. Accepting
an invite IS the approval: redemption is automatic on the next contact with a
member, and `lait invite --role viewer|contributor|administrator` decides what
the invite admits as.

### 3 · The daily loop, on a branch

Branch names carry the issue (`mp-1-fix-login-race`), so the loop needs no refs
and no context switch — and your teammate's activity finds you, you don't poll it:

```console
$ lait start MP-3               # assign me + in_progress + branch, one commit
MP-3  flaky reconnect  in_progress  · you
switched to new branch 'mp-3-flaky-reconnect'
$ lait comment "root cause: reused nonce"      # ref inferred from the branch
$ lait done

$ lait                          # your focus, <50ms
Inbox (2): bob commented on MP-2 · someone moved MP-2
$ lait inbox
• MP-2  bob commented on  polish header  — on it, root cause is the header cache
• MP-2  someone moved  polish header  — backlog → in_progress
```

The inbox is durable (survives restarts, unlike a feed you scrolled past) and
attribution-honest: comments carry their real author; state changes never guess.

### 4 · Your coding agent is a teammate

Membership is a keypair and an issue is a perfect unit of agent work, so an MCP
agent files, claims, comments, and closes issues exactly like a human — same
verbs, same audit trail:

```console
$ lait install-mcp --client claude
$ lait new "backfill created_at on legacy rows" -b "batched, dry-run first"
$ lait assign MP-4 agent        # any member — agents included — by name or key
# the agent: issue_start → comment progress → issue_done, over `lait mcp`
$ lait inbox
• MP-4  agent commented on  backfill created_at…  — dry run: 48,112 rows. PR up.
```

### 5 · Many clients, one machine

Spaces are discovered from the directory you stand in, git-style — and the
registry makes them addressable from anywhere:

```console
$ lait spaces
acme        ws_01JTHHNM0  founded  up    [ACME, DSN]
  ~/code/acme/.lait
kiln        ws_01JTGX2P1  joined   idle  [KLN]  (from mira)
  ~/code/kiln/.lait

$ lait -w kiln board            # target any space from any directory
$ lait config set project.default DSN   # per-space default for `new`/`board`
```

Project selection is one fixed chain: explicit `-p` → your branch's key →
`project.default` → the only project → a teaching error. Filters (`ls -p`) are
never defaulted, and `move -p` is always explicit — nothing silently guesses.

### 6 · A team that's rarely online together

Sync is peer-to-peer; a team spread across timezones pins one always-on peer
(any box running the same binary) that backfills whoever comes online:

```console
seedbox$ lait join <link> && lait daemon --seed    # never idle-shuts-down
laptop$  lait remote add <link-for-this-space>     # sticky; dialed every start
```

The seed holds ciphertext and the signed op-graph — it can neither read (E2EE)
nor forge (genesis-anchored signatures). See [docker-compose.yml](docker-compose.yml).

### Scripting

Every command emits a stable, versioned DTO under `--json` — the same shapes the
MCP tools return:

```bash
id=$(lait new "fix login" -p ENG --json | jq -r .reff)
```

`lait watch` follows the presence/join event stream and can run a hook per event
(`--exec CMD`) or raise a desktop notification (`--notify`). The hook runs in the
platform shell (`sh -c` on Unix, `cmd /C` on Windows) with the event as JSON on
stdin **and** in the environment:

```bash
# ping a webhook whenever someone asks to join
lait watch --exec 'curl -s -X POST "$WEBHOOK" -d "$LAIT_EVENT_NICK joined"'
```

| Env var | Value |
|---|---|
| `LAIT_EVENT_KIND` | `join` · `presence` · `system` |
| `LAIT_EVENT_NICK` | the peer's display name |
| `LAIT_EVENT_ID` | the peer's endpoint id |
| `LAIT_EVENT_TEXT` | human message |
| `LAIT_EVENT_SEQ` · `LAIT_EVENT_TS` | session sequence · unix ts |

## CLI reference

Issue verbs (act on one issue by `<ref>` — a short `iss_` handle or a `KEY-n` alias).
On a git branch named `eng-142-fix-login`, the ref is **optional** for `show` / `edit`
/ `move` / `history` / `delete` — lait infers `ENG-142` from the branch:

```bash
git switch -c eng-142-fix-login
lait show            # → ENG-142, no ref needed
lait edit --status in_progress
```

| Command | Description |
|---|---|
| `new <title> [-p PROJ] [-a USER…] [-P PRIO] [-l LABEL…] [-b BODY] [--start]` | Create an issue (`-p` optional: branch key → `project.default` → sole project; unknown labels created on first use) |
| `start [ref] [--no-branch]` | Claim + activate + branch: assign yourself, first active status, checkout `key-n-slug` |
| `done [ref]` · `stop [ref]` | Finish (first done status) · put down gracefully (backlog, unassigned). Refs infer from the branch |
| `inbox [--clear]` | Durable addressed-to-you: assignments, comments on your work, @mentions |
| `ls [-p PROJ] [--mine] [--status S] [--label L] [--all]` | List rows from the catalog cache (`-p` is a pure filter) |
| `board [PROJ]` | Render a project's board (positional optional, same chain as `new`) |
| `show <ref>` | Full issue (lazily loads the issue doc) |
| `edit <ref> [--title T] [--status S] [--priority P]` | Patch LWW fields (one activity row) |
| `move <ref> [-p PROJ] [--top\|--bottom\|--before R\|--after R]` | Set project and/or board order |
| `assign <ref> <who…> [--remove]` | Add/remove assignees |
| `label <ref> [+LABEL…] [-LABEL…]` | Add/remove labels |
| `comment [ref] [BODY]` | Append a comment. One arg on a KEY-n branch = the body (ref inferred); no BODY → stdin |
| `delete <ref>` | Tombstone an issue (stays in history) |
| `history <ref>` | The issue's derived activity feed |

Registries + node:

| Command | Description |
|---|---|
| `init [--name N] [--nick N]` | Found a space here (mints the genesis, seeds a first project) |
| `spaces [ls \| forget <sel> \| prune]` | Every space on this machine: name, origin, status, path |
| `config [get \| set \| unset \| ls]` | Layered local settings (`user.nick`, `project.default`); store wins over global |
| `projects [add KEY [NAME] \| ls]` | Manage the project registry (name defaults to the key) |
| `labels [new <name> --color C \| ls]` | Manage the label registry |
| `members [add \| remove \| name \| rotate-key \| ls]` | Manage E2EE membership (signed ACL); `add` seals the key, `remove` rotates it, `name` sets a local label for a key |
| `activity [--since N]` | Space-wide recent transitions |
| `serve [--port N] [--open]` | Open your spaces in a browser (loopback-only) |
| `status` · `id` · `shutdown` | Node/space status · endpoint id · stop the daemon |
| `invite [--role R] [--reusable] [--ttl-hours N]` · `join <link> [--dir D]` | Invite a teammate; `join` creates the joiner's store (cwd or `--dir`) and accepting the invite admits them automatically with the invited role's exact capabilities |
| `who` · `watch` | Peers online · follow the event stream |
| `profiles` / `resume <name>` | List profiles / switch to a named profile (each a separate identity + store) |

Global flags: `--home DIR`, `-w SEL` (target a space by name/id/path from any
directory), `--json`, `--no-color`. Exit codes: `0` ok · `1` usage/error · `2` ref
not found / ambiguous · `3` daemon unreachable.

## Use from an AI agent (MCP)

Register the MCP server with your agent in one step:

```bash
lait install-mcp --client claude     # or: cursor | windsurf | generic
```

It merges a `lait` entry into that client's `mcpServers` (preserving any
others), using this binary's absolute path and carrying `LAIT_HOME` if set.
`--scope user|project` picks the config location; `--print` shows the result
without writing. The MCP server binds a space the same way the CLI does (cwd
discovery or `LAIT_HOME`) — run it where a space exists (`lait init` /
`lait join` first; nothing is created implicitly).

Or add it to `.mcp.json` by hand:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "lait": {
      "command": "/absolute/path/to/lait",
      "args": ["mcp"],
      "env": { "LAIT_HOME": "/Users/you/.lait" }
    }
  }
}
```

Tools exposed: the full issue surface — `issue_new`, `issue_edit`,
`issue_move`, `assign`, `label`, `comment`, `issue_delete`, `issue_view`, `list`,
`board`, `history`, `project_new`, `project_list`, `label_new`, `label_list`,
`activity`, `member_add`, `member_remove`, `key_rotate`, `members` — plus
transport (`status`, `my_id`, `invite_ticket`, `join_room`, `connect`, `who`).
Each returns the **same versioned JSON DTO** the CLI `--json` emits; a build-gate
parity test keeps the agent and human surfaces in lock-step.

## Multi-node & end-to-end encryption

The default invite carries a **signed, single-use pass**, so a teammate is on the
board after a single `join` — no separate approval round-trip:

```bash
# host — mint an invite link (carries the space, genesis, and a single-use pass)
lait invite                        # → a link (+ a scannable QR); send it over

# teammate — join from the link (creates the store in the cwd, or pass --dir);
# the pass admits you automatically
lait join <INVITE> --nick bob
lait status                        # you: member   ← board decrypts and syncs

# later: revoke — rotates the key so bob can't read new content (lazy revocation)
lait members remove bob
```

The link carries a **bearer** admission capability: authority rides the channel
you send it over, bounded by expiry (`--ttl-hours`, default 7 days) and one use.
Accepting the invite is the approval — there is no queue and no approve step;
redemption completes automatically on the joiner's first contact with a member.
Tune what it admits:

```bash
lait invite --reusable --ttl-hours 24   # one link admits the whole team for a day
lait invite --role viewer               # read-only membership
lait invite --role administrator        # full policy administration (issuer must hold it)
```

Space data is E2EE: issues sync as ciphertext, and a node that isn't in the
signed ACL (or has been removed) sees only ciphertext. Automatic redemption
never weakens this — the seal still happens key-side on an admin node holding
the space key, which also verifies the capability, its signed role expansion,
and the issuer's authority to delegate every capability it grants. Changes propagate live P2P over iroh
with no central server; any always-on node advertised in a ticket acts as a
portable seed that backfills cold clients.

## Running several nodes on one machine

Set a distinct `LAIT_HOME` per node — one founds, the other joins from the invite
(there is no shared "room name": the gossip topic derives from the space id
carried in the ticket):

```bash
LAIT_HOME=/tmp/alice lait init --name demo --nick alice
LAIT_HOME=/tmp/alice lait invite                       # → <INVITE>
LAIT_HOME=/tmp/bob   lait join <INVITE> --nick bob
```
