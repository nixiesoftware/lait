//! The space supervisor — identity scoping, and lazy per-space daemon attach.
//!
//! Every Layer-B client before this one spoke to exactly **one** daemon: the
//! control channel is keyed by home ([`crate::control::control_name`]), and a CLI
//! invocation resolves exactly one store. The browser is the first client that is
//! *global to the machine* — a spaces picker means holding several daemons at
//! once — so this module is the piece with no prior art in the codebase.
//!
//! Two invariants shape it.
//!
//! **Never spawn what you were not asked for.** `SpaceDirectory::list` answers the picker by
//! probing (a short-timeout [`Request::Status`] that fails closed to `idle`),
//! never by starting anything: opening the browser must not wake every daemon a
//! user has ever registered. A space's daemon starts only when that space is
//! actually selected — see [`Supervisor::attach`].
//!
//! **Never cross an identity.** See [`scope`], which is the whole story.
