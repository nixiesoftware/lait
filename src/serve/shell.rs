//! The served client — the React app, compiled into the binary.
//!
//! `include_dir!` reads `src/serve/assets` at **compile time**, which is why that
//! directory holds *build output* and is *committed*. Three facts force it:
//! `Cargo.toml` excludes `viewer/` from the published crate, `publish-crates.yml`
//! is Rust-only, and `build.rs` deliberately never shells out to git so a plain
//! `cargo install lait` stays reproducible with no external toolchain. Building
//! the bundle during `cargo build` would need npm; leaving it in `viewer/` would
//! mean crates.io users get a head with no UI. So it lives here, in git.
//!
//! The honest cost is build output under version control, kept fresh by
//! `npm run build` (which writes straight here) and guarded by CI diffing a
//! rebuild. See `docs/UI.md`, web surface.
//!
//! Serving it from the daemon — rather than from a dev server or a CDN — is also
//! what makes the client **same-origin**, which is the precondition for the
//! `Origin` allowlist in [`super::auth`] meaning anything at all.
