//! `lait serve` — the local HTTP surface, and the browser's Layer-B client.
//!
//! The daemon's contract has always been [`crate::control`]: a versioned,
//! hand-maintained imperative façade over the CRDT, spoken over a Unix socket or
//! a named pipe. Native clients are local processes, so that
//! transport cost them nothing. A browser cannot speak a named pipe. This module
//! is the *one* adapter that closes that gap — the same `Request`/`Response`
//! types, the same `Doorbell` stream, re-bound to a loopback TCP socket and SSE.
//!
//! Two things follow, and they are the whole design:
//!
//! **This is a client of the host plane.** The compatibility control channel is
//! still keyed by home, while the browser is a picker over all registered
//! Orbits. [`crate::daemon::OrbitDirectory`] supplies discovery and
//! [`crate::daemon::ControlRouter`] supplies lazy Station placement, routing,
//! and doorbell fan-in.
//!
//! **The socket was the authentication.** Binding the same façade to a TCP port
//! removes the OS permission check that made auth unnecessary, and adds a caller
//! that never existed before: the web pages the user visits. See [`auth`].
//!
//! The browser is deliberately *not* a peer. It holds no key, has no entry in the
//! ACL, and is never invited: it is a lens on a device's replica, and the device
//! remains the only network identity.
