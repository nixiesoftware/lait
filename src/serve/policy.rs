//! `lait serve` exposes the control plane verbatim, so the browser is exactly as
//! privileged as the CLI — which is the intent: it is a Layer-B client, not a
//! lesser one. The two rules here are the places where that equivalence is
//! deliberately *not* total.

/// Whether `req` only reads.
///
/// An **allowlist**, and the direction matters. `Request` fields are add-only,
/// so a verb added after this was written must default to "not a read" — refused
/// for an identity that isn't ours — rather than quietly inherit permission. The
/// match is exhaustive rather than `_ => false` for the same reason: a new variant
/// should fail to *compile* until somebody classifies it, instead of picking a
/// side on its own.
///
/// `Inbox` is the one conditional, and it is why this cannot be a per-variant
/// list: `clear: true` advances the read watermark (`inbox::mark_read`), so it is
/// a write wearing a read's name.
