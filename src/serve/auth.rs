//! Loopback authentication for `lait serve` — re-establishing in userspace what
//! the control socket got from the OS for free.
//!
//! [`crate::control`] has never carried authentication, and correctly so: a Unix
//! socket is gated by filesystem permissions and a Windows named pipe by its
//! DACL, so *being able to open the channel* *is* the credential. Native clients
//! inherit that protection by being local processes.
//!
//! An HTTP port inherits none of it. Two distinct callers appear the moment the
//! same façade is bound to a socket the network stack will route:
//!
//! 1. **any other process on the machine** — loopback has no peer credential we
//!    check, so a different user's process can connect; and
//! 2. **any web page the user visits** — this is the sharp one. A page cannot
//!    read a cross-origin response, but it can *send* the request, and DNS
//!    rebinding (`evil.com` re-resolving to `127.0.0.1`) is specifically designed
//!    to make the browser treat us as same-origin and hand over the reply.
//!
//! So this module reconstructs the socket's implicit guarantee out of three
//! explicit ones. They are defence in depth: each closes a hole the others leave.
//!
//! - **Bind loopback only.** The caller binds `127.0.0.1`, never `0.0.0.0` —
//!   otherwise the LAN gets a vote. Not enforced here; see [`super::run`].
//! - **A per-run bearer token** ([`Guard::check_token`]). Minted at startup,
//!   never persisted, handed to exactly one browser through the opened URL. This
//!   is what stops the *other local process*, which can reach the port but cannot
//!   guess 32 random bytes.
//! - **A strict `Host`/`Origin` allowlist** ([`Guard::check_origin`]). This is
//!   the part that actually defeats rebinding, and it is worth being precise
//!   about *why* the token alone does not: after a successful rebind the browser
//!   believes `evil.com` *is* our origin, so it will attach our cookie to the
//!   attacker's request. The token stops being a secret the attacker lacks. What
//!   the attacker cannot forge is the `Host` header — the browser derives it from
//!   the URL the attacker had to use, so a rebound request arrives stamped
//!   `Host: evil.com` and we refuse it before the token is ever consulted.
//!
//! Both checks are pure functions over header values precisely so the policy is
//! unit-testable without binding a port — the same shape as
//! [`crate::control::check_control_protocol`] and [`crate::sync`]'s version gate.
