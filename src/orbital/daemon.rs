//! The orbital daemon (C5 step 5) — the product's control surface served over
//! the orbital `Runtime`, replacing the legacy `Replica`/sync/gossip node.
//!
//! It composes [`OrbitalMechanics`] (authority/keys/membership over signed
//! material), an issues [`Runtime`] hosting [`IssuesWorld`], and a [`Station`]
//! with the comms Contact plane, then serves the **same** newline-delimited
//! `control::Request`/`Response` IPC the CLI/serve/MCP speak — so those clients
//! are unchanged. Application requests route through [`IssueRouter`] Sessions;
//! peer exchange is Contact/Convergence over `comms`; invitation is Coordinates
//! v1; `Subscribe` streams the Station's `ObservationStream` as `Doorbell`
//! frames.
//!
//! Every control request has an explicit terminal owner (see
//! `tests/control_classification.rs`): product intents/queries route to the
//! World Session; membership, admission, device, key and the FROST
//! recovery/elevation/custody ceremonies are served by [`OrbitalMechanics`]
//! over the mechanics primitives; seeds, diagnose, inbox and log are node-local
//! lifecycle concerns. There is no catch-all refusal.
