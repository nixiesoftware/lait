//! LAIT's control adaptation of the mechanics ceremony engine.
//!
//! The generic ceremony state machine — break-glass recovery, FROST
//! elevation, threshold signing, custody export/import, artifact storage —
//! lives in [`mechanics::ceremony`]. This file only composes the engine over
//! the product's [`Inner`] mechanics state: it borrows the authority ledger,
//! injects the Body-key epoch fence (mint a fresh epoch when this device is an
//! admin holding none), and forwards the control-surface calls.
