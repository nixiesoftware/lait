///
/// The third plane to get one. The sync plane has [`crate::sync::PROTOCOL_VERSION`]
/// and the store has `dto::SCHEMA_VERSION`; the control channel had nothing, so a
/// client meeting a daemon of another vintage found out by failing to decode its
/// answer — which `ensure_daemon` read as "no daemon", spawned a doomed second one
/// over the held lock, and finally blamed a timeout. Same rules as the sync plane:
/// bump this for a backward-compatible change, raise
/// [`MIN_SUPPORTED_CONTROL_PROTOCOL`] only when dropping support for an old one.
///
/// Version 1 is the first: a daemon that does not answer `hello` at all predates
/// the handshake (v0.4.8 and earlier) and is reported as such.
///
/// **v2:** the space-vocabulary flag day renamed fields carried on this plane —
/// `Diagnose.expected_space`, `StatusInfo.space`, `IssueView.space_id`. A v1
/// daemon cannot answer them, so v1 is retired rather than tolerated: a client
/// that decoded a v1 answer would read absent fields as absent state.
///
/// **v3:** explicit Space/World routes name the local Orbit as well as the
/// expected Space. A v2 per-home route selected the Orbit only out-of-band via
/// its socket, which cannot address two local Orbits in the same Space through
/// one future daemon endpoint.
///
/// **v4:** product calls use a versioned opaque [`WorldCall`] envelope at the
/// identity-scoped daemon.
///
/// **v5:** attached SpaceBridge processes accept that same opaque envelope
/// directly. Typed product requests and the root-owned compatibility codec are
/// retired, so v4 processes cannot remain attached across this boundary.
