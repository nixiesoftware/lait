//! Layer B — the local control protocol. Newline-delimited JSON over
//! the cross-platform local IPC channel (a Unix-domain socket on unix, a named
//! pipe on Windows; see [`control_name`]). One request → one response, plus the
//! streaming [`Request::Subscribe`] mode that writes [`Doorbell`] frames until
//! the client disconnects.
//!
//! This is an **imperative façade over a declarative CRDT**: a stable, versioned,
//! hand-maintained projection of durable state, never an automatic dump. `Ref`s
//! and `who-ref`s arrive as plain strings and are resolved **daemon-side**.
