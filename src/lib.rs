//! lait: a local-first, peer-to-peer issue tracker.
//!
//! One binary, four roles:
//!   * `lait daemon` runs the orbital Station: mechanics authority, the Body
//!     replica, comms transport, and the docked Issues World.
//!   * `lait <cmd>` is the CLI client, driving the daemon over a local IPC
//!     control channel.
//!   * `lait serve` binds that same façade to loopback HTTP + SSE so a browser
//!     can be a client too ([`serve`], `docs/UI.md`). The only surface global
//!     to the machine: it supervises one daemon per space.
//!   * `lait mcp` exposes the same Layer-B façade as MCP tools for an agent.
//!
//! The crate is split lib + bin so integration tests, doctests, and the MCP/DTO
//! parity check can exercise the same code the binary runs. See `docs/`.
//!
//! Layering (see `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` and `docs/DATA-CONTRACT.md`):
//!   * **The substrate** (`mechanics`, `fabric`, `replica`, `comms`,
//!     `runtime`): authority, convergence, the Body graph, transport, and the
//!     orbital lifecycle, each behind its own crate boundary.
//!   * **The product** ([`world`], [`orbital`]): the Issues World contract and
//!     the composition root that docks it.
//!   * **Layer B — control protocol** ([`control`], [`dto`]): a stable,
//!     versioned, hand-maintained projection over the local socket. Never a
//!     dump of storage internals.

// planes, derivation rules — in a crate that lists no scaffold, so no CRDT or
// transport reference there can compile. Re-exported here so the app layer
// keeps reaching them by their historical crate-root paths (`crate::acl`,
// `lait::crypto`, …); the boundary is enforced by the kernel crate's manifest,
// not by these aliases.
