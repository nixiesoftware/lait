//! The guided-join verifier core (see `docs/UI.md`, joining).
//!
//! A **pure projection** of live daemon state into an ordered list of onboarding
//! *gates*, so a stalled joiner gets one legible line naming what's blocking them
//! instead of a blank board. Kept deliberately free of I/O, ANSI, and daemon
//! types: it takes primitive inputs and returns a [`DiagnosisView`] DTO, so the
//! exact same logic backs CLI `doctor`, the `join` tail, and the MCP `doctor`
//! tool, and is unit-tested without a running node. The active StationHost
//! gathers the inputs; everything downstream renders the DTO.
