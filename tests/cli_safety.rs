//! Guards for the two promises the CLI makes before it does something you can't
//! undo, and before it blames the wrong component.
//!
//! 1. **Ask before destroying.** `delete` takes its ref from the git branch when
//!    you omit it, so it is the one verb that can tombstone something you never
//!    named. It must refuse rather than guess — and, with no terminal to ask on
//!    (CI, an agent, a pipe), it must refuse *without blocking* and name `--yes`.
//!    A prompt that hangs a CI job is worse than no prompt at all.
//!
//! 2. **Tell a foreign daemon from an absent one.** A daemon that is listening but
//!    speaks a different wire shape (an older lait still running after an upgrade)
//!    used to be reported as "no daemon" — which spawned a doomed second daemon
//!    over the held lock and waited out a 20s timeout before blaming the timeout.
//!    Detection is at the transport level, so this stays true across wire changes.
//!
//! 3. **Report failures in one voice.** Every client-side error goes through the
//!    top-level reporter: one lowercase `error:` line, the versioned DTO under
//!    `--json`, and the documented exit code. `main` returning `Result` used to
//!    hand these to anyhow's `Termination`, which broke all three.
//!
//! 4. **Never hold your stdout hostage.** A command that auto-spawns a daemon must
//!    still hit EOF when it exits: whoever captured it (`$(lait new …)`, a test
//!    harness, an MCP client) reads until EOF, so a daemon left holding the write
//!    end hangs the *caller*, not the daemon. Windows-only in practice — see
//!    `disinherit_stdio` in `app.rs` — but the promise is platform-independent.
