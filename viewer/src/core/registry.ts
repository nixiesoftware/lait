/**
 * The seam.
 *
 * There is one vocabulary in this client — the `Command` — and one door into it,
 * [`contribute`]. Keys, the palette, the shortcuts overlay, buttons, and menus do
 * not *do* anything: they resolve to a command id and run it. Every surface that
 * lists commands is a **projection** of this registry, never a second list.
 *
 * The property that makes the seam real rather than decorative: **the core uses
 * it too.** Every built-in command in `src/commands/` is registered through
 * `contribute()`, exactly as a third party would. There is no privileged path, so
 * anything the core can do, an extension can do — and anything the core does
 * wrong, an extension can override. A test pins this.
 *
 * Inherited from the TUI's `keymap.rs`, deliberately and verbatim in spirit:
 *
 * - **Overrides replace an action's key set; they do not add an alias.** If a
 *   command ships with `["mod+k", ":"]` and you override it to `["ctrl+p"]`, `:`
 *   stops working. This surprised people in the terminal too, and it is still the
 *   right call: the alternative is bindings you cannot remove.
 * - **Warn, never gate.** An unknown id or an unparseable chord produces a
 *   warning and is skipped. A typo in a config file must never take the client
 *   down — you would have no way to fix it from inside a broken app.
