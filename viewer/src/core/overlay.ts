/**
 * The optimistic overlay — a local prediction, keyed by `(doc_id, field)`.
 *
 * Ported from the TUI's, and the word that carries the whole design is
 * **correlation-free**: there are no request ids, no pending queue, no rollback
 * log, no version vectors. A prediction is one cell, and it dies when *any* server
 * news arrives for its doc.
 *
 * The doorbell is the spine. It says "doc D is dirty" and carries no state, so the
 * client re-reads the authoritative projection and drops every guess about D. The
 * arrival of truth invalidates the guess — there is nothing to match up, which is
 * exactly why nothing can leak: a prediction cannot outlive the fact it predicted.
 *
 * Three ways a prediction dies:
 *   1. **A doorbell for its doc** — the normal path (see `App`'s handler).
 *   2. **An immediate error** — the request was refused; roll the guess back now.
 *   3. **The TTL** — see below.
 *
 * The TTL is the one thing the terminal version did without, and deliberately so:
 * against a local daemon over a Unix socket, a request that neither errors nor
 * produces a doorbell is close to impossible. A browser is not that. A dropped
 * fetch, a suspended tab, a socket that quietly went away — and the prediction
 * sticks forever, showing a value that no longer exists anywhere. So predictions
 * expire, and the UI falls back to whatever the server last said.
