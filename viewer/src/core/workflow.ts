/**
 * Where the work-state verbs land.
 *
 * `issue_start`/`_done`/`_stop` do not name a status — they name a **category**, and
 * the daemon resolves it as *the first state in workflow-list order whose category
 * matches* (`replica.rs::first_state_in`). So `start` on the default workflow means
 * `in_progress`, and on a workflow whose first Active state is `triage` it means
 * `triage`.
 *
 * This is a deliberate second copy of a daemon rule, which the client otherwise
 * refuses to make (see `core/filter.ts` on why `mine` is never guessed at). The
 * difference is what the copy is *for*: this one only ever feeds
 * `Overlay.set(doc, "status", …)` — a prediction, which is marked as unconfirmed on
 * screen and which the next doorbell overwrites with server truth regardless of
 * whether we guessed right. Being wrong here costs one frame of a wrong column, not
 * a wrong answer. Filtering has no such backstop: a mis-guessed `mine` silently
 * shows you someone else's issues and nothing ever corrects it.
 *
 * `states` must be in board order — `BoardView.columns` is, because the daemon
 * builds it by walking the workflow list.
