/**
 * The work verbs' target resolution.
 *
 * This is a deliberate second copy of a daemon rule (`replica.rs::first_state_in`),
 * kept only to feed the optimistic overlay — so the tests that matter are the ones
 * pinning *which* rule it copies. "First in list order matching the category" is not
 * "the state whose id is `in_progress`", and a workflow that renames or reorders its
 * states is exactly where the difference shows up.
