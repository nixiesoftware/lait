/**
 * Attribution.
 *
 * Two invariants, both load-bearing, both burned by a real bug:
 *
 * 1. **`synced` never carries a name — even with a resolver.** In the space
 *    Activity feed a remote change is one synthetic event stamped with the *local*
 *    node's key, so resolving that key would credit you with a teammate's edit.
 * 2. **History attribution reads `actor`, not `actor_nick`.** The durable history
 *    feed leaves `actor_nick` empty and puts the real committer's key in `actor`;
 *    a client that reads `actor_nick` for the name shows nothing. (This is exactly
 *    what regressed when the engine moved history onto the oplog — the guard in
 *    `tests/viewer_read_contract` catches it engine-side; these tests pin the
 *    client half.)
