 * Fuzzy ranking, ported from the TUI's `palette.rs`.

 * Greedy and left-to-right, so it can miss a better alignment further along. That

 * not what cmdk expects.
 *
 * Two traps, both survived by real bugs:
 *
 * - An empty search returns 1 (show everything, in source order) rather than
 *   scoring — otherwise the list reorders itself before you have typed anything.
 * - The result is shifted above zero. A legitimate match can score 0 or less via
