 * The engine, from the browser.
 *
 * This file is the whole backend. The previous viewer had a `server/` directory —
 * a Vite middleware that spawned `lait --json` once per request and re-parsed its
 * stdout — because there was no other way in. Bare `lait` runs the HTTP head,
 * which exposes the control plane directly, so all of that collapses to `fetch`.
 *
 * Everything is same-origin: the page is served by the engine itself, so the
 * `HttpOnly` cookie rides along and no token is ever visible to script. In dev the
 * vite proxy fakes that (see vite.config.ts) rather than the engine relaxing its
 * origin guard.
