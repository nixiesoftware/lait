/**
 * A member, as a circle.
 *
 * There are no avatar images in lait and there will not be: a member is an ed25519
 * key plus a **local** petname (`MemberDto.alias`, never synced). So identity has to
 * be drawn from the only thing everyone agrees on — the key — and the petname rides
 * on top for whoever set one.
 *
 * The colour is derived from the key, which makes it the one honest half of the
 * identity: two nodes that disagree about what to *call* someone still draw them the
 * same colour, because they agree about the key. The letter comes from the petname
 * and can differ between nodes — that is the model working, not a bug (S non-goal 6:
 * nicks are advisory, keys are authenticated).
 *
 * An unnamed member gets a glyph rather than a letter pulled from their key. A hex
 * digit is not an initial; rendering `7` as though it named someone would be
 * inventing an identity the system does not have.
 *
 * The one exception to "no images": a **sponsored agent** whose local petname names
 * a known coding tool (Claude / Codex / Grok) is drawn with that tool's brand mark
 * (`agentLogos`). It rides purely on the local `alias`, so it changes nothing about
 * the key-derived identity underneath — it is a rendering affordance, not a synced
 * fact.
