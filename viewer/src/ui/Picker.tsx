/**
 * A pill that opens a searchable menu — the tracker's workhorse control.
 *
 * **One control, not one per field.** Status, priority, assignees, labels, and
 * project are all "pick from a set", and the moment they stop being the same
 * component they start disagreeing: about where the check mark goes, whether the
 * menu closes on pick, whether search exists. That drift is invisible in review and
 * obvious in use, so there is exactly one of these.
 *
 * **The search field is always there**, including over four statuses where it looks
 * like overkill. Two reasons, and the second is the real one:
 *
 * 1. It makes every picker keyboard-complete — `s` `d` `o` `n` `↵` sets Done without
 *    the hand leaving the keys, which is the whole point of this client.
 * 2. `cmdk` drives its list from the input's focus. Hiding the input below some
 *    threshold means Radix focuses the popover content instead, and the keydown
 *    never reaches `Command`'s handler — arrow keys silently stop working on
 *    exactly the small menus that looked too simple to break.
 *
 * Radix's Popover owns focus trapping, escape, outside-click, and collision
 * flipping; `cmdk` owns roving focus, `aria-activedescendant`, and scroll-into-view.
 * The *ranking* stays ours (`cmdkFilter`), so the palette and every picker agree on
 * what "matches" means.
 *
 * `open`/`onOpenChange` are exposed so a keybinding can open a picker — `a` has to
 * reach the assignee menu without a mouse, and a component with private open state
 * could not be driven from the registry.
