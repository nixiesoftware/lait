/**
 * The doorbell stream — one `EventSource` over every attached space.
 *
 * A frame is a **dirty flag, never state**: the client re-reads the authoritative
 * projection and never patches from the frame (UI.md §5). That is what keeps the
 * browser honest about a CRDT it does not hold.
 *
 * Note what this client does *not* yet do. §5's contract is per-*scope* re-reads —
 * intersect `dirty_by_project` with what is on screen and fetch only that. We
 * re-read everything a ring could plausibly have touched: correct, and wasteful.
 * `dirty_by_project` is read only to decide which optimistic guesses to retire, and
 * `activity_advanced` / `presence_advanced` are not read at all. Say so here rather
 * than describe the design we mean to have.
 *
 * `lagged` means the server's broadcast dropped frames under load; its contract is
 * the same as `reset` or an `epoch` change — rebaseline rather than trust the view.
 * We surface it as a bare "something changed, trust nothing" signal, because the
 * recovery is identical and pretending otherwise invites a subtle bug.
 *
 * `EventSource` reconnects on its own, so there is no retry loop here — only the
 * liveness the user should see.
