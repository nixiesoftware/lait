//! **The network adapter** — how independently held replicas exchange their
//! material, and the only crate that names a concrete network.
//!
//! Kernel determines legitimacy and Fabric maintains the shared world; those two
//! are lait's substrate. This crate is neither: it is the replaceable mechanism
//! that moves their bytes between peers. The application composes all three.
//!
//! Two halves, and the distinction is the point:
//!
//! - [`policy`] owns *where* lait operates — the public relay mesh, a named local
//!   relay, or isolated. lait states its requirement; the contractor fulfils it.
//! - this module owns *how* — dialing, gossiping, and accepting through
//!   [`Transport`] in lait's own vocabulary ([`PeerId`], [`Topic`], framed
//!   [`Stream`]s, [`GossipEvent`]s), never through a vendor's connection types.
//!
//! One policy, N transports: the shipped one over QUIC ([`DefaultFactory`]) and a
//! deterministic in-process one ([`mem::MemTransport`]) that lets the *real
//! daemon* run with no network at all.
//!
//! **The host is the consumer, not the transport.** Its identity hub owns the
//! concrete endpoint and gives each Station an `Arc<dyn Transport>` scoped to
//! one Space. Swapping the in-memory transport for the shipped one changes
//! *nothing* above this seam.
//!
//! Identity note: [`PeerId`] is a [`DeviceId`] — a peer *is* its ed25519 key (the
//! T0 identity agreement). The concrete transport converts at its own edge;
//! nothing above this seam names a foreign id type.
