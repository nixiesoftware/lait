//! Agreement test at the **transport seam**: lait's identity model and iroh's

//!
//! This is the executable form of the claim `config`/`ids` rely on — a lait
//! `DeviceId` *is* the iroh `EndpointId`, so a box sealed to a member opens for the
//! device that holds the corresponding transport secret. It lives here, at the
//! seam (where iroh is named), not in the kernel: the kernel defines identity in
//! its own terms; this pins that iroh honors the same definition. If a future
//! iroh changes its key encoding, THIS test breaks — not the kernel.
