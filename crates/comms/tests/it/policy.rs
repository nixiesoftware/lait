//! Tests for the network-policy seam (`comms::policy`), driven through lait's REAL
//! reachability path.
//!
//! Under `Local`, lait dials peers by **bare `EndpointId`** (its address-free
//! design) and resolves them through a `MemoryLookup` it populates with
//! `{id, relay}` — the address lait already knows because it configured the
//! relay. No discovery service, plaintext or otherwise, exists to fake. These
//! tests use exactly that construction (`comms::policy::relay_addr` + a
//! `MemoryLookup`, then `connect(bare_id)`), so a green result reflects the
//! daemon's actual mechanism, not an iroh feature.
//!
//! The self-signed in-process relay needs cert-verification skipped, which iroh
//! gates to test builds; that lives here (a dev-dependency), never in the
//! shipped `build_endpoint`.
