//! [`Session`] — a local caller docked to a hosted World.
//!
//! A Session is bound to one World, principal, and Station activation epoch.
//! Sessions are many-to-one, independently closeable, and **cannot** stop the
//! Station. Authorization is checked per request, not only at Dock.
//!
//! The dispatch seam: `submit`/`query` **validate the request against the
//! World's registration, contain a World panic, and build a bounded**
//! [`WorldContext`](crate::world::WorldContext) over the principal before routing
//! to the World implementation. Before the World is called the Session
//! enforces: the Station is live; the payload is within
//! [`WorldLimits`](crate::world::WorldLimits); the intent/query names a declared
//! schema+version (a query may also read a declared readable predecessor); and
//! the principal's standing is **re-resolved through the mechanics
//! [`AuthorityView`](crate::world::AuthorityView)** for this request. A panic in
//! the callback is caught as [`WorldError::WorldPanicked`] and never
//! ends the Station.
//!
//! After the World stages its effect, the Session **contains** it — every staged
//! operation and scope must address the Session's own World namespace with an
//! operation kind that World's registered mutation models allow — then performs
//! the authority-frontier compare-and-swap under the writer lock, and durably
//! commits. Success means recoverable, not merely applied in memory.
