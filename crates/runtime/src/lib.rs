//! **Runtime** — LAIT's orbital lifecycle.
//!
//! ```text
//! Space
//!   +-- Orbit: one device's durable relationship to the Space
//!         +-- Replica: durable local materialization
//!         +-- Station: that Orbit activated for exclusive local operation
//!               +-- hosted World implementation
//!                     +-- docked Session
//! ```
//!
//! Runtime owns the domain lifecycle: forming/entering/observing/acquiring
//! Orbits, activating them into Stations, hosting Worlds, docking Sessions,
//! Contact policy, and Observation publication. It exposes **no** CRDT, iroh,
//! stream, file, key, ciphertext, mutex, or product request types — those live
//! below the boundary in [`fabric`], [`comms`], and [`mechanics`].
//!
//! An Orbit is the durable relationship and persists while vacant or occupied.
//! The Rust handles encode its exclusive operational lease:
//! [`Orbit::activate`] consumes the vacant Orbit handle and returns a
//! [`Station`]; [`Station::go_dormant`] consumes the active Station handle and
//! returns a vacant Orbit handle. Those ownership transfers are not an
//! ontological conversion between Orbit and Station.
//!
//! S0 establishes the sealed lifecycle contract surface and a **real, tested**
//! immutable World registry (duplicate registration is rejected). The lifecycle
//! transitions are wired in later stages (Orbit in S2, Station in S3,
//! World/Session/Contact in S5); their signatures here fix ownership and
//! consumption semantics.
