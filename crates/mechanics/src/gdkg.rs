//! Dealer-free general-access key generation.
//!
//! [`crate::gaccess`] signs from shares a *trusted dealer* handed out. This module removes the
//! dealer: the key is generated so that no single party ever holds the secret
//! `x`, yet the resulting shares have the same MSP form the signer consumes.
//!
//! Construction — Feldman-VSS-per-contributor, aggregated over the span program.
//! Each contributor `p` samples its own distribution vector `ρ^(p) ∈ F^d`
//! (`d = cols`), publishes Feldman commitments `C^(p)_j = ρ^(p)_j · G`, and deals
//! leaf `i` the sub-share `s_i^(p) = ⟨A_i, ρ^(p)⟩`. Leaf `i` accepts dealer `p`
//! only if the sub-share matches the commitments:
//!
//! ```text
//! s_i^(p)·G  ?=  Σ_j A_{ij} · C^(p)_j
//! ```
//!
//! The group aggregates over accepted contributors:
//!
//! ```text
//! x   = Σ_p ρ^(p)_0            (nobody computes this — it is the secret)
//! Y   = Σ_p C^(p)_0 = x·G      (public key)
//! s_i = Σ_p s_i^(p)            (leaf i's aggregate share; only i learns it)
//! S_i = s_i·G                  (public per-leaf commitment)
//! ```
//!
//! Because each contributor's sub-shares are MSP-consistent with `ρ^(p)`, the
//! sum is MSP-consistent with `ρ = Σ_p ρ^(p)`: a qualified set's reconstruction witness
//! reconstructs `Σ λ_i s_i = x`, so the [`crate::gaccess`] signer produces a
//! signature under `Y`. The `dkg_output_signs_under_gaccess` test closes that
//! loop end to end.
//!
//! # Security status
//!
//! Everything the [`crate::gaccess`] header says applies here, plus DKG-specific
//! gaps this functional prototype does **not** address:
//!
//! - **Public-key biasing.** This is a Pedersen/Feldman-style DKG. A rushing
//!   adversary who chooses its contribution after seeing others' commitments can
//!   bias the distribution of `Y` (Gennaro–Jarecki–Krawczyk–Rabin). The hardened
//!   construction commits (hiding) before revealing; that round, and the
//!   complaint/disqualification protocol that makes aborts identifiable, are the
//!   production protocol must include — not implemented here.
//! - **Transport & authentication.** Sub-shares here are passed in-process. The
//!   private per-leaf channel, its authentication, and encrypted-share dealing
//!   are out of scope for the algebra.
//! - **Qualified-contributor set.** This aggregates whatever honest
//!   contributions it is given; agreeing on the accepted-contributor set under
//!   partial failure is outside this algebraic prototype.
//!
//! This module is not wired into the space authority path. It validates that
//! dealer-free generation yields shares the general-access signer accepts; that
//! functional result does not establish active-adversary security.
