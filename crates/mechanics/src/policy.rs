//! Ownership-policy grammar and canonical identity.
//!
//! A space's ownership rule is a **monotone** boolean formula over principals:
//! "one lead", "all founders", "any 2 of these 3", "two from Team A and one from
//! Team B". This module is where that rule is written, normalized to a single
//! canonical form, and content-addressed to a stable [`PolicyId`].
//!
//! # Three identities, kept apart
//!
//! [`PolicyId`] is the **human ownership rule** and nothing else. It is *not* the
//! compiler's `AccessStructureCommitment` (the exact linear-secret-sharing
//! output) nor the deployed `AuthorityConfigurationId` (the scheme, compiler
//! version, and expansion actually operating a key). A compiler upgrade or a
//! custody change alters the deployed configuration without touching the human
//! policy; conflating the three is how "the policy changed" checks start lying.
//!
//! # Why two types
//!
//! [`OwnershipPolicy`] is the authoring surface — four variants, ergonomic to
//! write. [`CanonicalPolicy`] is the normal form: `Key` and `Threshold` only,
//! and the *only* thing that hashes to a [`PolicyId`]. You cannot address a
//! non-canonical policy, because the sole path to an id is
//! [`OwnershipPolicy::canonicalize`] → [`CanonicalPolicy::id`]. Expansion and
//! compilation consume the canonical *structure*, so it is a value that travels,
//! not a hashing detail.
//!
//! # Monotonicity is structural
//!
//! There is no `Not`, no negative threshold. The grammar admits only monotone
//! formulas by construction, so there is nothing to check at runtime: adding a
//! signer can never turn a satisfied policy unsatisfied.
