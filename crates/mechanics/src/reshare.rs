//! Proactive same-key resharing.
//!
//! ```text
//! Policy P1, shares S1, public key Y   →  authorized resharing  →  Policy P2, shares S2, public key Y
//! ```
//!
//! Move a secret from one access structure to another **without changing the
//! public key and without anyone ever reconstructing the secret `x`**. Each
//! member `i` of a qualified old set `Q` re-shares its *own* share `s_i` — a
//! value it legitimately holds — as the sub-secret of a fresh sharing over the
//! new matrix `A₂`:
//!
//! ```text
//! σ^(i) ∈ F^{d₂},  σ^(i)_0 = s_i        (dealer i knows s_i; nobody learns x)
//! C^(i)_l = σ^(i)_l · G                  Feldman commitments; C^(i)_0 = s_i·G = S_i
//! u_j^(i) = ⟨A₂_j, σ^(i)⟩                sub-share to new leaf j
//! ```
//!
//! New leaf `j` combines the sub-shares it received with the **old** witness
//! coefficients `λ_i`:
//!
//! ```text
//! t_j = Σ_{i∈Q} λ_i · u_j^(i) = ⟨A₂_j, Σ_i λ_i σ^(i)⟩ = ⟨A₂_j, ρ'⟩
//! ρ'_0 = Σ_i λ_i σ^(i)_0 = Σ_i λ_i s_i = x        ⇒   new key = x·G = Y (unchanged)
//! ```
//!
//! The recomputed key `Σ_i λ_i S_i` must equal the old `Y`, and each `C^(i)_0`
//! must equal the old public share `S_i` — so a dishonest old holder cannot
//! substitute a different sub-secret. The result is a fresh [`crate::gdkg::GroupKey`]
//! under the same `Y`, holding new shares over the new leaves.
//!
//! # Security status
//!
//! Beyond the [`crate::gaccess`]/[`crate::gdkg`] boundaries: resharing is **not
//! a revocation mechanism**. An old qualified coalition that kept its old
//! shares can still sign under the unchanged `Y`, and an ordinary Schnorr
//! verifier cannot tell which sharing produced a signature — the
//! `an_old_coalition_can_still_sign_after_resharing` test states this in code.
//! A governance change that must *remove* an old capability uses key rotation, not
//! this. Same-key resharing is legitimate only under an explicit proactive model
//! (secure erasure of old shares, bounded mobile corruption, authenticated
//! handoff) or a monotone change where every old qualified coalition stays
//! authorized — a classification this prototype does not enforce. A production
//! protocol also needs an epoch and secure-erasure model (for example,
//! CHURP-style); this module implements only the share-transfer algebra and is
//! not wired into the space authority path.
