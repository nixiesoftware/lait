//! These are pure wrappers over `frost-ed25519` that move only **serialized
//! packages** and index participants by a 1-based `u16`, so the interactive
//! rounds can ride any transport — the membership-doc bulletin board (broadcast
//! round-1, sealed round-2), or copy-paste. Secret packages/shares are returned
//! as bytes for the caller to persist offline; nothing here touches the plane,
//! which only ever verifies one Ed25519 signature ([`crate::space`]).
//!
//! Round map (mirrors the frost API): DKG is `part1→part2→part3` (3 rounds,
//! round-2 packages are targeted secret shares); signing is `commit→sign→
//! aggregate` (2 rounds). See RFC 9591.

//
// Move the standing group secret from one flat-threshold arrangement to
// another **without changing the public key and without reconstructing the
// secret** (Desmedt–Jajodia redistribution over the frost Shamir shares).
// Every old holder in a fixed qualified set Q re-shares its own share `s_i`
// as the constant term of a fresh degree-`k'-1` polynomial, commits to the
// coefficients (Feldman; `C_0 = s_i·G` must equal the dealer's published old
// verifying share), and deals an evaluation to every new participant. New
// participant `j` combines the dealt sub-shares with the old Lagrange
// coefficients: `t_j = Σ_{i∈Q} λ_i·g_i(j)` is a Shamir share of the SAME
// secret over the new threshold. The new public key package is computed from
// the commitments alone and carries the unchanged verifying key.
//
// This is the share-transfer algebra only. Resharing is NOT a revocation: an
// old qualified coalition that kept its shares can still sign under the
// unchanged key (see `crate::reshare`'s module docs for the proactive model).
