//! Authority transitions: candidate evidence, generation-bound custody, and the
//! transition lifecycle as a deterministic projection.
//!
//! A transition moves the recovery authority from one configuration to another.
//! Its lifecycle is **not** a mutable state field — it is a pure projection over
//! grow-only events, every one bound to a [`TransitionId`], so every replica
//! computes the same state and a liveness failure never leaves two plausible
//! standing configurations.
//!
//! # Trust model
//!
//! Activation evidence is **generation-bound participant attestations plus a
//! candidate-key possession signature** — not an unproven publicly-verifiable
//! DKG proof. Be precise about what that proves:
//!
//! > Participant attestations prove that the named operators *claim* to have
//! > validated and backed up their shares. They are accountable, signed
//! > statements — not a zero-knowledge or publicly-verifiable proof of correct
//! > DKG execution.
//!
//! The possession signature proves the candidate key is *operational under at
//! least one qualified set*: it is a group signature under the new key, carrying
//! the [`crate::dkg::SigningPlan`] and reconstruction witness that produced it.
//! [`CandidateEvidence`] keeps format space for a future reviewed transcript
//! proof to be added without a redesign.
