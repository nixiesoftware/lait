//! Generic ceremony orchestration owned by mechanics.

//! This module owns the complete generic ceremony state machine — break-glass
//! recovery, FROST elevation, threshold signing, custody export/import, the
//! device-local artifact store, and the semantic result types — plus the
//! ceremony-material retention policy. Product layers supply only control
//! request/result adaptation; they never advance a transcript themselves.
//!
//! Ceremony material is a distinct journal class with its own bounded cursor;
//! only a transcript's one terminal `SpaceAuthority` effect ever enters an
//! authority frontier. Body-key policy stays outside: the engine calls an
//! injected epoch fence after a terminal install and never touches Body
//! encryption itself.
