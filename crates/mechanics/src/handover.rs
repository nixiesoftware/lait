//! Authority rotation and disjoint handover.
//!
//! A rotation installs a **new, independent** authority: a fresh [`crate::gdkg`]
//! run produces a new key `Y₂` unrelated to the old `Y₁`. Because the new key is
//! independent, the old and new holder sets need not overlap — disjoint handover
//! is exactly as valid as an overlapping one. What makes the handover safe is not
//! shared shares but a signature: **the old authority signs the installation**,
//! and only after it has pinned the exact candidate key, configuration,
//! transcript evidence and activation custody rule. No old holder trusts a key
//! merely because a new participant claims to have derived it.
//!
//! This module defines the bytes the old authority signs ([`InstallationTerms`]),
//! and — given a set of *signed* installations — decides which one wins and
//! projects the outcome ([`resolve`]). Selection verifies each signature under
//! `Y₁` and picks the smallest `(transition id, installation identity)` among the
//! authorized ones — resolving even two conflicting terms for one transition
//! deterministically — so every replica converges without coordination. The
//! signature itself is an ordinary
//! [`crate::gaccess`] signature under `Y₁`, so a solo old key (1-of-1), a flat
//! FROST old key (k-of-n) and a general-policy old key all install a successor
//! the same way.
//!
//! # Security status
//!
//! The [`crate::gaccess`]/[`crate::gdkg`] boundaries carry over. **Scope:** this
//! module binds and authorizes the *installation signature* and decides the race
//! among authorized installations. It deliberately does **not** validate a
//! candidate's possession evidence, its signing plan/witness, the custody acks,
//! or transition readiness — candidate-evidence and custody-readiness checks must pass
//! before an installation is signed, and they live above this module. The
//! partition-tolerant agreement and liveness layer is not implemented. This
//! functional prototype is not wired into the space authority path.
