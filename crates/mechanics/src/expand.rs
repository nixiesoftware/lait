//! Principal-to-leaf expansion.
//!
//! [`crate::policy`] gives a canonical policy over **principals** (ownership identities). Before
//! it can become a cryptographic access structure, each principal must expand to
//! the **leaves** that actually hold shares:
//!
//! - a **Direct** principal is one leaf, operated by one device;
//! - a **Federated** principal expands into a whole sub-policy — a founder that
//!   is itself a group — which inlines into the global tree rather than becoming
//!   an opaque nested key. (Treating a founder's internal group as an opaque
//!   leaf would require nested signing orchestration and a separate backend.)
//!
//! # Immutable, configuration-bound
//!
//! Expansion is a pure function of `(CanonicalPolicy, resolver)`. It never reads
//! mutable "current profile" state, so the same inputs always yield the same
//! leaves and the same provenance — the snapshot a deployed configuration binds.
//!
//! # No silent weight; distinct occurrences get distinct leaves
//!
//! One principal may own several rows: if `a` occupies two *genuinely distinct*
//! positions in the policy (canonicalization already rejected literal duplicates), each
//! position expands to its own leaf with its own id. The leaf id is derived from
//! the **occurrence path**, so two occurrences of one principal — or one device
//! backing two leaves — never collapse. Additional weight thus requires distinct
//! occurrences and never appears by accident.
