//! `lait/space/1` — the **self-certifying space** and its **root lifecycle**.
//!
//! Membership made *identity* self-certifying (`ActorId = H(inception)`); this
//! does the same for the **space** one layer up, and gives its trust root a
//! **break-glass recovery** path.
//!
//! # Self-certifying id
//!
//! ```text
//! space_id = ws_<crockford128( blake3("lait/space/1" ‖ device ‖ salt ‖ recovery_commit) )>
//! ```
//!
//! The founding device key + a random salt + the recovery commitment are hashed
//! into the id *before* the founding actor is incepted (an inception is scoped to
//! a space id, so the id cannot depend on it). The signed inception is then
//! the "Found" artifact: `ws_id` commits to the device, the inception commits to
//! `ws_id`, and `founder_actor = H(inception)`. A joiner given
//! `{ws_id, salt, recovery_commit, founder_inception}` verifies the chain offline.
//!
//! # Root lifecycle — a single rotating recovery authority
//!
//! `genesis.founding_actors` is only the *bootstrap* root: it seeds `acl::replay`.
//! Ordinary governance (add/remove admins) rides the ACL. What the ACL cannot do
//! is re-root when the live admin set is **lost or compromised** — that is the
//! break-glass [`Recover`](SpaceOp::Recover).
//!
//! Recovery authority is **one public key** — the same shape whether it is a plain
//! solo key or a **FROST threshold group key** produced by K-of-N holders (a group
//! signature verifies as a plain Ed25519 signature, so the plane never sees the
//! threshold; it lives entirely in the off-plane signing ceremony). The space
//! commits to `recovery_commit = blake3(recovery_pubkey)` in its id at birth
//! (mirroring actor recovery's pre-rotation commitment): a `Recover`/`Rotate` is
//! authorized when its author hashes to the current commitment.
//!
//! [`Rotate`](SpaceOp::Rotate) installs a *new* recovery key — signed by the
//! *current* one — so authority can be **elevated** (found solo, then rotate to a
//! DKG group key as co-founders come online) without ever touching `ws_id`. `gen`
//! is strictly monotone, so an old op cannot be replayed.
