//! Membership and access control through an **actor-keyed** signed ACL op-graph.
//!
//! Membership binds an [`ActorId`] — a
//! self-certifying identity over a self-managed set of device keys
//! ([`crate::actor`]). Every op is still signed by exactly one device (the
//! [`SignedNode`] envelope is unchanged), but authority resolves through one
//! indirection: each op **declares the actor it speaks for** (`by`) and the
//! frontier of that actor's key-event log its author observed (`actor_asof`),
//! and replay verifies the signing device belonged to that actor *at that
//! frontier* before weighing the actor's standing. This keeps replay a pure
//! function of `(genesis, actor events, acl ops)` — never a current-state gate
//! — so replicas at different sync points converge (the content-authority
//! doctrine, applied one layer down). Authors MUST land any actor events an
//! op's frontier references in the same commit as the op (see
//! `MembershipDoc::add_actor_event`), so no replica ever holds an op whose
//! frontier it cannot resolve.
//!
//! **Grants, not roles.** Standing is an extensible capability set
//! ([`Grant`]): `Admin` (membership authority) and `Write` (content
//! authority). A member with **no grants is view-only** — sealed the key,
//! zero write standing. A **sponsored** member (an agent) is not a separate
//! kind of actor: it holds the *same* grant set as any member (default
//! `Write`), authored on a human's sponsorship, and its standing **dies with
//! that sponsor**. The one hard fence: a sponsored member may hold content
//! authority (`Write`) but never membership authority (`Admin`) — it authors
//! no ACL op (the blanket agent-author ban in `judge_op`), so it can file,
//! close, and comment like a colleague yet cannot add/remove members or rotate
//! the key. Sponsorship is a membership *modifier*, orthogonal to the grant
//! set — rendered, never a gate.
//!
//! **Names never enter this plane.** The only synced identity facts are keys,
//! actors, and signed ops; petnames live in each node's local alias store.
//!
//! Trust maximum unchanged: replay is deterministic (topo order, remove-wins,
//! sponsor cascade), undecodable ops are opaque DAG nodes (ancestry, no
//! state), and the E2EE epoch remains the recency fence (removal rotates the
//! space key so a removed actor's devices cannot read forward).
