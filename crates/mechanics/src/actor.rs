//! The **actor identity plane** — the third signed hash-DAG plane
//! (`lait/actor/1`), beneath membership. Where the ACL ([`crate::acl`])
//! answers *which actors are here* and content authority
//! answers *which high-consequence actions were taken*, this plane answers
//! *which device keys speak for an actor* — and it is the only plane that is
//! **self-authorized**: an actor adds, revokes, and recovers its own devices;
//! no admin signs a device event.
//!
//! **The split this plane creates.** A `DeviceId` (ed25519 device key) *signs*;
//! an [`ActorId`] *is someone*. Every op on every plane is still signed by
//! exactly one device (the [`SignedNode`] envelope binds the author key into
//! both signature and content-address — that stays). Authority questions gain
//! one indirection: "is this author an admin" becomes "is the author device a
//! device of the claimed actor *at the declared frontier*, and is that actor
//! an admin at this op's causal position."
//!
//! **Self-certifying identity.** `ActorId = act_ + blake3-hash(Incept event)`.
//! No registry mints it and none can forge it: any replica holding the
//! `Incept` event validates the id by rehashing. The `Incept` payload binds
//! the space id + a nonce, so actors are **per-space** — the same human in
//! two spaces is two unlinkable actors (cross-space linking is a local
//! address-book concern, never protocol state).
//!
//! **Consent bindings.** Every device in an actor's set consented: a
//! [`DeviceBinding`] carries the device's own signature over the binding
//! context (`lait/devbind/1`) plus a fresh per-binding nonce, so no actor can
//! claim a key it does not control and no consent can be replayed.
//! - For an `Incept` the actor id does not exist yet (it *is* the event's
//!   hash), so consent binds the **whole inception core**: `(space ‖
//!   binding nonce ‖ incept nonce ‖ sorted device keys ‖ recovery commit)`.
//!   Binding the full core is what stops a device's consent being replayed
//!   into a *different* inception (different device set or recovery commitment)
//!   that reuses the incept nonce.
//! - For `AddDevice`/`Recover` consent binds `(space ‖ binding nonce ‖
//!   actor id)`, and replay enforces the nonce is **single-use per actor**, so
//!   an old consent cannot be replayed to re-add a device after its revocation.
//!
//! **Recovery (pre-rotation, KERI-shaped).** An `Incept` may commit to
//! `blake3(recovery pubkey)` — the key itself stays offline. A `Recover`
//! event is *authored by the recovery key* (mechanically just another ed25519
//! key in the envelope), must hash to the standing commitment, wholesale
//! resets the device set, and commits to the next recovery key (or burns
//! recovery with `None`). Because a compromised device never holds the
//! recovery key, only the true owner can produce a valid `Recover`.
//!
//! **Deterministic replay, two passes — the [`crate::acl`] shape.** Pass 1
//! authorizes events at their causal position in deterministic topo order
//! ([`sigdag::topo_order`]). Pass 2 applies the safety overrides:
//! **revoke-wins** (a revoke not causally succeeded by a re-add evicts the
//! device even against a concurrent add — remove-wins, pointed at the same
//! safe side as membership) and **recovery-wins** (device-authored events
//! *concurrent with* a valid `Recover` are struck: the compromised branch
//! cannot race the recovery). Replay is a pure function of the event set —
//! never a current-state gate — so every replica converges (the
//! content-authority doctrine, one layer down).
//!
//! **Recovery supremacy.** Recovery-wins is applied *before* revoke-wins by
//! striking every device-authored event (adds *and* revokes) concurrent with a
//! commitment-valid `Recover`, so a struck concurrent revoke can never override
//! a device the recovery reinstated. A `Recover` is "valid" only if commitment-
//! valid — envelope-signed by the recovery key (which *is* the author: there is
//! no separate `recovery_pub` field to mismatch) whose `blake3` equals the
//! standing commitment — so a signature-valid-but-commitment-invalid `Recover`
//! has zero effect and never triggers the strike.
//!
//! **The accepted residual** is the same class the content plane names: a still-
//! bound device can author ops embedding a pre-revocation frontier until the
//! revocation propagates — bounded by concurrency, remediated by an explicit
//! counter-op. Not a new risk class.
//!
//! **Accepted limitation — recovery-key compromise is unrecoverable takeover.**
//! Two commitment-valid concurrent `Recover`s (only possible if the recovery
//! *private* key leaked) are resolved by the deterministic topo tie-break,
//! which an attacker can grind. This is the identity analogue of losing a root
//! secret: guard the recovery key offline. A co-signed-recovery upgrade
//! (recovery + a surviving device) is future work, not v1.
