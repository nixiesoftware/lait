//! The frozen collaborative-operation algebra (S1a).
//!
//! This module fixes the LAIT Body operation algebra's **declared semantics** and
//! **bounds** so an implementation (S5, through Engine) and an independent World
//! author agree on behavior. It is LAIT semantics, not a copy of the CRDT engine's API.
//!
//! # Paths
//!
//! A collaborative operation addresses a location by a `path`: a `/`-separated
//! sequence of 1–64 segments, each 1–64 bytes of `[a-z0-9_]`. The empty path
//! addresses the Body root. Paths are compared byte-exact; there is no Unicode
//! normalization and no implicit array indexing in the path (list positions are
//! carried in operation fields, not the path).
//!
//! # Stable element identity
//!
//! Ordered-list and set elements have **stable element ids** assigned by Engine
//! at insert time and echoed to the World in Projections. `ListRemove`/`ListMove`
//! name an element by that id, never by index, so a concurrent insert cannot
//! shift the target of a remove. `index` in `ListInsert`/`ListMove` is a
//! placement coordinate resolved against the committed order at apply time.
//!
//! # Concurrency winners
//!
//! - Registers and map entries are last-writer-wins by the semantic transaction
//!   order Engine commits; concurrent sets to the same path both survive as
//!   conflicting versions only until the next observed commit resolves them.
//! - Ordered lists converge by stable-id insertion order (no lost inserts;
//!   concurrent inserts at the same index interleave deterministically).
//! - Sets are add-wins; a concurrent add and remove of the same value keeps it.
//! - Counters sum all increments (commutative).
//! - Text splices converge by the CRDT's per-character identity; overlapping
//!   splices never corrupt, though they may interleave.
//!
//! # Idempotence
//!
//! Applying the *same* committed transaction twice is a no-op (Replica advances
//! its frontier only once per transaction id). Re-submitting an equivalent
//! intent under a **new** request id is a new transaction, not idempotent.
//!
//! # Type conflicts
//!
//! A path bound to one collaborative type (register/map/list/text/set/counter)
//! cannot be reused as another. An operation whose type disagrees with the
//! established type at a path is a `TypeConflict` and commits nothing.
//!
//! # Limits (frozen)
//!
//! See the constants below. Exceeding any bound rejects the whole transaction
//! with a limit error and commits nothing.
//!
//! # Schema upgrades
//!
//! A schema version declares `readable_predecessors` (strictly older, distinct
//! versions). Reading an older Body under a newer supported version is allowed;
//! writing always uses the schema's own version. Downgrade is never implied.
