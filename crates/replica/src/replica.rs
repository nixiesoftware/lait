//! [`Replica`] — the committing semantic layer over a Fabric engine and the
//! canonical durable Body store.
//!
//! Replica translates a validated set of staged [`BodyOp`]s into semantic
//! [`FabricOp`]s, submits them to a Fabric engine for an atomic apply, and
//! advances its semantic frontier **only** from the returned Fabric receipt.
//! It never authors a raw document delta and never fabricates a receipt.
//!
//! **The canonical store.** A durable Replica persists — through the Fabric
//! journal's six-step commit protocol, at one linearization point per
//! transaction — the canonical signed [`BodyTransaction`] record, one sealed
//! [`ProtectedBodyPayload`] object per changed Body (`epoch_id[16] ||
//! nonce[12] || ciphertext_and_tag`; no plaintext Body payload is ever at
//! rest), the [`RequestReceipt`] idempotency record, and the signed Manifest
//! root/pages over the full Body set. Recovery reopens exactly that graph: a
//! Body whose key-epoch material is locally held is opened, validated, and
//! imported into the engine; a Body whose epoch key is absent is retained
//! **opaquely** — byte-identical, never decrypted, absent from reads — until a
//! key legitimately arrives.
//!
//! **Convergence.** [`Replica::incorporate`] accepts only a signed
//! [`BodyTransaction`] plus the exact descriptor-bound protected payloads:
//! mechanics validates the signer's standing at the transaction's referenced
//! authority frontier, every payload must match its descriptor's ciphertext
//! commitment, and only then does material reach the engine — per Body, via
//! [`fabric::Fabric::import_body`], never as a raw engine snapshot. Supported
//! material becomes exact per-Body Fabric changes; unsupported-but-legitimate
//! material (unknown World/schema, or no local key) is retained opaquely and
//! forwarded byte-identically. Body-level tombstones are local retirement:
//! cross-replica deletion is application state inside a Body, so a tombstoned
//! Body simply leaves this Replica's manifest.
