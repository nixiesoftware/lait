//! The Fabric operation surface and engine — the sealed contract Replica drives.
//!
//! Fabric is LAIT's canonical, sealed Loro component and the only crate that
//! names Loro. It exposes **LAIT-owned** semantic operations and results, never
//! raw documents, containers, or Loro frontier types. Replica validates and
//! constructs a semantic transaction plan, submits it to a Fabric-owned
//! [`Fabric`] engine, and advances its semantic frontier only from a durable
//! [`FabricCommitReceipt`]. Fabric never imports Replica.
//!
//! **Ownership boundary (enforced, not just documented):**
//! - Replica submits *semantic* [`FabricOp`]s — it never authors a Loro delta.
//!   The concrete translation to Loro is Fabric-private.
//! - [`FabricCommitReceipt`] and [`CausalToken`] can be constructed **only**
//!   inside this crate (their constructors are `pub(crate)`), so a receipt is
//!   proof of a real Fabric commit — an outside crate cannot forge the token
//!   Replica advances from.
//!
//! [`CrdtFabric`] is the sole engine: atomic Bodies plus the frozen
//! collaborative algebra (register/map/list/text/set/counter with stable
//! element identity) over real Loro containers — one Loro document per Body,
//! so per-Body export/import carries exactly one Body's causal history — with
//! batch atomicity. The durable store is the journaled protocol in
//! [`crate::journal`], persisting per-Body protected objects.
