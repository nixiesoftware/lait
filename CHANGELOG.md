# Changelog

## v0.7.6 — the instruments stop lying

> **Upgrading:** `host_update` then `host_restart` on the host plane, or re-run
> the installer. Nothing moves on disk, on the peer wire, or in the control
> protocol. Two things change what they report: `status.online_peers` may show
> fewer peers than before, and `sync` now contacts your peers before answering,
> so it takes as long as a Contact round rather than returning instantly.

Four diagnostics that reported health they had not established. Each was found
by being wrong about a real fault, and together they are why that fault took a
day to corner: every instrument agreed the node was fine.

### `sync` reported converging without doing any

It documents itself as "converge now — the request that supersedes a hand-aimed
`Connect`". It contacted nobody: it read the local epoch keyring, found nothing
missing, and answered "converged — this view is complete". That is what a
replica holding zero items returned, repeatedly, beside a peer holding 244.

Contact is a pull — only the dialer incorporates — so converging *is* dialing,
and a sync that dials nobody has converged nothing. It now dials (bounded, and
it says when it drops peers) and reports how many were reached, which failed and
why, and whether anything arrived. `whole` keeps its meaning — every authorized
epoch key is held — and stops being phrased as though it meant "up to date with
your peers".

### `Binding` was a sink, not a reason

`contact: Convergence("Illegitimate(Binding)")` is where a peer's material dies,
and `Binding` did not mean a binding check had failed. It was where every
string-described refusal inside contact validation ended up — thirteen distinct
causes reported identically, each having written a description that was then
discarded. The refusal now carries it.

### The daemon log could not receive anything

`daemon.log` is 0 bytes on a healthy node and always has been. The spawner hands
the log file to the child's stderr and nulls its stdout; the tracing subscriber
wrote to stdout. Some sixty `warn!`/`error!` sites went to the null device,
including the implementation-drift check that names its own remedy and the store
watchdog. The file the error messages point operators at was structurally
incapable of holding anything.

### A node had two answers to "is anyone there"

`diagnose` argued with itself inside one sentence: *"1 peer online, but none will
be dialed"*. The count came from `status`, filtering on a latched reachability
flag; the verdict came from `who`, which v0.7.4 corrected to require recency.
One function answers it now, used by both.

## v0.7.5 — a refused Contact says what it refused

> **Upgrading:** `host_update` then `host_restart` on the host plane, or re-run
> the installer. Nothing moves on disk, on the peer wire, or in the control
> protocol. A refusal that used to read `Convergence` now reads
> `Convergence("…")` with the reason inside.

`contact: Convergence` was the entire diagnostic. A receipt that would not
verify, an implementation the Space does not have active, a key epoch this node
cannot open, a malformed manifest, a Body that failed its check — every one of
them collapsed to that single word, and nothing logged the cause either, because
it was discarded before any tracing could see it.

The distinctions matter exactly there and nowhere else. A node in this state
connects, transfers, and keeps nothing: it looks reachable, it reports a peer,
its dial succeeds, and its store stays empty. There was no way, from inside the
process or outside it, to learn any more than the word.

The refusal now carries its cause and logs it at the point it happens, so
`connect` reports it inline and an operator reading the daemon afterwards does
not have to have been holding the connection open when it failed.

This diagnoses; it changes no behaviour. A replica that refuses everything it is
sent is a real fault, and the point of this release is to find out what it is
rather than to keep guessing.

## v0.7.4 — say why a Neighbor is not being dialed

> **Upgrading:** `host_update` then `host_restart` on the host plane, or re-run
> the installer. Nothing moves on disk, on the peer wire, or in the control
> protocol. `who` gains fields; every existing one keeps its meaning except
> `online`, which is corrected below.

A node can stop converging entirely and look perfectly healthy. This release
does not fix that — it makes it visible, which it was not.

### Why it hides

Contact is a **pull**: only the dialer incorporates what it receives, so a node
that never dials never receives. Eligibility to dial requires a queued Contact,
an elapsed backoff, and an unexpired route lease — and a *successful* Contact
clears the queued mark. Only a beacon advertising news, a local commit, or a
newly learned route re-arms it. A node that reads and does not write therefore
falls out of the schedule and stays out, while every diagnostic gate passes.

None of that left the process. The Neighbor projection carried station,
reachability and last-seen, and dropped the three fields the scheduler actually
reads. From outside, a stalled node and an idle one were the same picture.

### What you can see now

`who` answers the question directly. Each peer carries **`dialable`** and, when
false, **`blocked_by`** in the scheduler's own words — not pending, or backoff
with the failure count, or an expired route lease — plus the `pending`,
`due_in_secs`, `route_lease_secs` and `failures` behind it.

`diagnose` reads the same projection, so the peer gate and the peer list cannot
disagree, and it now distinguishes *"nobody is here yet"* from *"nobody will be
dialed"*. The second is a warning that names the blocker, because waiting will
not clear it.

### `online` no longer latches

Reachability was set on a successful Contact and never decayed, so a Station
contacted once reported itself online indefinitely — one read `online`
twenty-six hours after its last Contact. `online` now also requires having been
heard from recently; believed-reachable but long unheard is `away`, the state
this used to skip straight past.

## v0.7.3 — a dev machine catches its own stale builds up

> **Upgrading:** `host_update` then `host_restart` on the host plane, or re-run
> the installer.
>
> **This release breaks compatibility with v0.7.2 and earlier stores and peers.**
> `ActivateWorldImplementation` — the authority effect recording which World
> implementation a Space runs — now carries the activated descriptor's declared
> version beside its id. That is a durable authority-op shape change with no
> migration, so a fleet moves together. A space founded on v0.7.2 opens and reads
> on this build, but do not expect a mixed fleet to converge.

Two things on a development machine go stale silently, and neither had a signal,
let alone a repair. They are the same shape: something is still running, or still
in force, from a build that is no longer the one on disk.

### The Space's active World implementation

Receipts pin whichever implementation id is **active in the ledger** — not this
build's — so a build whose descriptor has moved on silently attests an
implementation it is not. The check for that existed and reported through the
daemon log; the remedy it named, `world_upgrade`, was reachable only by raw HTTP
to the Issues world route, absent from the app and from MCP.

An admin node whose declared version is **strictly ahead** now activates its own
at open and takes the Space with it. Strictly, and only ahead: activating on any
difference would make each restart a coin toss between whichever boxes happen to
be up, and every flip invalidates writes pinned to the id it replaced. The
declared version gives one total order every node agrees on, so a fleet converges
on the newest build rather than the last-started one.

Rollback stays available and stays explicit — `world_upgrade` on an older build
still activates it, because that is an instruction rather than an incidental
restart, and it is an MCP tool now.

A node that is *behind* writes nothing, so the new `implementation` gate in
`diagnose` is the only place that disagreement surfaces. It **warns and never
blocks**: a drifted node reads and writes perfectly well, and telling somebody
they are locked out of a board on their screen would be a lie.

### The daemon itself

A rebuilt binary leaves the previous build's daemon holding the home, answering
every request while running code that is no longer on disk. The protocol
handshake could not see it — both builds speak the same protocol — so it was
reused. `Hello` now carries a build fingerprint and the launcher compares it,
stopping a superseded daemon and starting its own.

The rule is deliberately narrow: **the same executable path, restamped**. A
different path is never stale, because a client is not always the binary it would
spawn. Age alone is not enough either, or two binaries run in turn would each
evict the other's daemon at startup and neither would stay up.

### Also

- `fix(ci)`: the manifest job's corrected-file fallback was unreachable — a
  failed push halted the job before the upload that exists for exactly that case.

## v0.7.2 — a window could lose every way to reach its own spaces

> **Upgrading:** `host_update` then `host_restart` on the host plane, or re-run
> the installer. Nothing moves on disk, on the peer wire, in any World
> implementation, or in the local control protocol — this release is the browser
> surface and the bundle the binary embeds. An existing Space opens as it is and
> v0.7.0/v0.7.1 peers still converge.

### Three ways the shell dropped navigation and left nothing to bring it back

There is no command surface to fall back to, so each of these was terminal for
whatever it hid.

- **Founding and entering had one door, and opening a space shut it.** Both were
  reachable only from the empty state — which is precisely what having a space
  open replaces — and a single space auto-selects. So the app that had just
  opened a space could no longer create a second, and *someone invited to a
  second space had nowhere to paste the link*. The space menu is on screen
  whatever you have open, so **Add space** lives there now. One entry rather
  than one per verb: founding and entering are two answers to the same errand,
  and the surface behind it already asks which with a tab strip.
- **A registry row whose store was gone could not be removed.**
  `host_orbit_forget` and `host_orbit_prune` were declared in the viewer's
  request union with no caller anywhere, so a `missing` row drew a red dot
  naming a remedy nothing could send and sat in the switcher for good. Both are
  now in the menu, behind confirmations that state what they do and do not
  touch — neither goes near the store on disk.
- **A narrow window hid the rail and the toggle that opens it.** `Show sidebar`
  was gated on the panel's own collapse state, and the rail is hidden by CSS at
  the breakpoint — `display: none` is invisible to the layout library, which
  goes on reporting the width it had. The shell believed the rail was on screen
  while you were looking at a window with none, and ⌘B was the only way in.

### The shell sheds the right panel first

Fixing the last of those exposed the shedding order as backwards. At 955px the
shell dropped *all* navigation while holding a pinned 340px project console —
which left the issue list narrower than keeping both would have. The console is
a view of the project already on screen and every row in it is reachable from
that project's own pages; the rail is the only navigation there is.

| Width | Workspace rail | Project console |
|---|---|---|
| ≥ 961px | panel | shown (unchanged) |
| 769–960px | **panel** — was: gone | hidden |
| ≤ 768px | drawer, with the toggle that opens it | hidden |

In that middle band you now get navigation back *and* a wider list — at 955px it
goes from 615px to ~774px. The console's toggle leaves with the console, because
a control whose only effect is invisible is the same defect in miniature.

## v0.7.1 — the control channel stops paying for what it carries

> **Upgrading:** `host_update` then `host_restart` on the host plane, or re-run
> the installer. Nothing on disk, on the peer wire, or in any World
> implementation moves, so an existing Space opens as it is and v0.7.0 peers
> still converge. The one version that moves is the **local** control protocol
> (9 → 10), which reaches exactly one thing: the daemon still running under your
> old binary. The launcher identifies it as older and takes over.

### The local control channel stops paying for what it carries

Two changes to the head↔daemon hop, neither of them visible in the product
except as latency.

- **One connection carries many requests.** A head opened a socket, wrote one
  line, read one line, and dropped it — per request. Measured on named pipes,
  500 round trips: **63.4µs each with a connect per request, 13.8µs pooled**.
  The connect was 4.6× the exchange it existed to carry. The daemon now serves
  until the client leaves or an operation takes the stream over.
- **World call payloads are framed, not base64'd.** JSON cannot hold bytes, so
  every board, list, and comment crossing this channel was base64'd into its
  header and parsed back out — a third more wire and two passes each way. The
  header now declares a length and the bytes follow it, exactly as content has
  worked since v7. Encode/decode cost for one call, by payload size:

  | payload | v9 (base64) | v10 (framed) | wire |
  |---|---|---|---|
  | 1 KiB | 46.9µs | 12.8µs | −21% |
  | 64 KiB | 2.19ms | 26.3µs | −25% |
  | 1 MiB | 37.2ms | 200µs | −25% |

**BREAKING (local wire):** `CONTROL_PROTOCOL_VERSION` 9 → 10, minimum also 10.
A v9 daemon reads a framed payload as a malformed second request, and on a
channel that now reuses connections that desynchronises everything after it
rather than failing once — so it is refused rather than tolerated. Nothing on
disk, on the peer wire, or in any World implementation moves; the launcher
identifies an older daemon and takes over from it, as it already did.

The re-send rule is the load-bearing part. A request is re-sent only when a
connection *the client had parked* failed before answering — the daemon closed
it while idle, so nothing was delivered. A connection opened by the call itself
gets no such licence. What makes a half-written framed call undelivered is the
receiver rather than the ordering: a World call is dispatched only after its
declared bytes are read in full.

### Also fixed

- **The coverage-manifest CI job could not push its own fix.** It computes the
  refreshed manifest correctly and then 403s, because `actions/checkout`
  persists the default token as a git `extraheader` that authenticates the push
  even when the URL carries an App token — so it went out as
  `github-actions[bot]`, which has no write permission. The header is now
  dropped before the push. Every test-adding PR was a manual round trip until
  this.

## v0.7.0 — lait is not a command surface

> **The CLI is gone.** Not deprecated, not hidden behind a flag — deleted. `lait`
> is now a launcher that picks one of three processes and starts it, and every
> operation that used to be a verb is a request one of those three carries.

### Upgrading into it

Run `lait update` on v0.6.3 — the old binary's verb still works, and it is the
last one you type. From here, upgrading is node maintenance: `host_update` on
the host plane swaps the binary and `host_restart` makes the swap take effect,
or re-run the installer from the README.

Nothing on disk changes: the store manifest, the Contact generation, and the
Issues World's reviewed implementation are all where v0.6.3 left them, so an
existing Space opens as it is and peers on v0.6.3 still converge. The **control
protocol** moves 8 → 9 with no mixed-version window, which only matters to the
daemon left running under your old binary — the launcher identifies it as older,
takes it over, and carries on. That needs nothing from you.

### Where everything went

- **The app is the interface.** Bare `lait` starts the daemon and serves the
  browser client on `127.0.0.1:7717`, which is now the default rather than a
  `serve` subcommand. `--json` prints one readiness line — `{url, token, port}` —
  before the listener accepts, so a parent process can read one line and know
  the port is live.
- **Founding and joining are a screen, not a command.** With no space on this
  machine you land on **Welcome**: *Found a space* (`host_space_found`) or *Use
  an invite* (`host_space_enter`). Nothing is created implicitly, so the first
  act is still deliberate.
- **Bootstrap lives on the identity-scoped daemon**, behind `POST /api/host/rpc`:
  formation, device consent, local config, the Orbit registry
  (`host_orbit_forget` / `host_orbit_prune` / `host_orbit_rebuild`), MCP install,
  self-update and restart, and orientation (`host_context`). That route exists
  because founding a Space is precisely the state in which there is no space id
  to put in a path — every other `/api` route is `/api/spaces/{id}/…`.
- **Devices and recovery got a home.** A new Settings tab covers device
  enrolment, revocation, listing, and the space custody share — the enrolment
  half that runs on a machine with no membership anywhere (`host_device_consent`)
  is on the host plane for the same reason formation is.
- **Self-update is node maintenance.** `host_update` swaps the binary (the
  daemon is the process that knows which build it is running), and `host_restart`
  stops the daemon *under* a head so the swap takes effect; the head stands a
  fresh one back up on the next send. `Stop` is deliberately not on the host
  plane — a page able to send it could kill the server answering it.
- **`watch --exec` became a stream.** `GET /api/events` is the doorbell SSE
  stream; presence, carets, and drained signals ride the `/api/session` socket.
- **Scripting is HTTP.** There is no `--json` on a verb because there are no
  verbs; the three planes return the same versioned DTOs the MCP tools do.
  `ci/smoke-p0.sh` now drives the head instead of the CLI, which makes the smoke
  test an executable specification of the interface.

### Removed behaviour, stated plainly

- **Branch inference is gone.** lait no longer reads the issue off your git
  branch, and `issue_start` no longer cuts one. Those were properties of a shell
  running inside your checkout; the app does not run inside anything.
- **Shell completions and the man page are gone**, along with the command tree
  they were generated from.

### Custody, restated because it now has one enforcement point

A sponsored agent is **not** read-only and never was second-class: it holds
`Standing::Write`, and through its own node (`lait mcp`) it files, comments,
closes, and deletes issues like any contributor. What the head refuses is a
write routed *into* an agent-held Orbit by somebody else — a Station carrying
its own identity directory signs with that seed, so such a write would go out
over the agent's signature, and Mechanics would approve it because it evaluates
the signer's grants. That refusal is about **custody, not standing**: it must
stay no however wide anybody's grants become. Reads are never refused —
observing a hosted identity's board signs nothing. `Catalog::signs_with_own_seed`
is the one predicate; `serve::borrowed_key_refusal` is the one refusal.

### Docs

- New [`docs/SERVE.md`](docs/SERVE.md): the three planes, the Bearer/Origin
  posture, and the custody fence.
- `README.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`, `docs/UI.md`,
  `docs/AGENT-EXPERIENCE.md`, `docs/INSTALL.md`, `docs/PROTOCOL.md`,
  `docs/SPECS.md`, `docs/THREAT-MODEL.md`, `docs/COMPATIBILITY.md`,
  `docs/README.md`, `viewer/README.md`, the packaging manifests, and the bundled
  skills were swept for CLI invocations; each one now names what to do instead.
## v0.6.3 — a cache miss is not a corrupt ledger

> **A one-fix release.** If v0.6.2 opens your Space, this changes nothing you
> can see. If it told you `authority ledger corrupt`, this release opens it and
> loses nothing — no re-init, no re-join, no `lait rebuild`.
>
> ```
> lait update
> ```

### The fix

`Authority::open` decoded every indexed checkpoint and treated a decode failure
as a corrupt ledger. A checkpoint carries no fact the signed effects do not
already carry — it is a cache of their deterministic replay — so the only thing
that failure mode cost was the ability to open a store whose every effect was
intact.

The semantics version could not rescue it. `semantics` is the checkpoint's first
field precisely so a stale one can be discarded, but the whole struct is decoded
before that comparison is reached. A layout change to `ReplayCheckpoint` — or to
anything it holds, such as `AclState` or `PolicyPass` — that lands without a
`LEDGER_SEMANTICS_VERSION` bump therefore made every store already carrying a
checkpoint refuse to open, permanently, with nothing actually wrong with it.

Such a checkpoint is now discarded and rebuilt from the signed effects, exactly
as a stale-semantics one already was.

**This does not weaken "corruption is an integrity failure."** Damaged bytes fail
their content address in the journal before any decode is attempted and remain an
integrity failure. What is newly tolerated is the opposite case: bytes that hash
correctly and describe a layout this build no longer speaks. The two were
conflated; they are now distinguished.

### Reading the failure

Worth knowing if you ever meet this class of error: `lait status` printed only
`authority ledger corrupt`, because tracing initializes in the daemon process
rather than the CLI. The diagnostic underneath — here
`checkpoint: Found a bool that wasn't 0 or 1` — is visible by running the daemon
directly:

```
RUST_LOG=mechanics=debug lait daemon
```

## v0.6.2 — files move, cursors move, and work gets something to answer to

### Files are content, not fields

- **The content plane.** Files live in an immutable, content-addressed store
  beside the journal, reachable by a content id that carries its own descriptor.
  A range read costs the range rather than the file, a resident cache holds what
  this node has fetched under a quota it can forget, and a name a peer chose is
  never a path this machine writes.
- **Freight is mounted, not merely advertised.** `lait/freight/1` routes: an
  admitted peer's availability question and ranged chunk request are served from
  committed descriptors and validated proof sidecars. For two releases both
  planes were advertised and unserved — the endpoint registered the ALPN, the
  handshake completed, and the hub turned the opening away because no driver
  owned the plane. `Orbit::activate` mounts both now.
- **Attachments became content everywhere at once.** The write path is a clean
  break — nothing emits the old inline `data_b64` shape, and the encoder that
  produced it is deleted from both the engine and the viewer. The read path is
  permanent: both shapes decode through one type, so every attachment ever
  written stays readable. The old shape was bounded at 256 KiB by 8, so the worst
  legacy Body is 2 MiB and needs no streaming reader.
- **Files over the browser surface**, with uploads that are not garbage while
  they wait to be attached, and a server that can be told to stop.

### Collaboration you can see

- **Realtime collaborative text editing.** CodeMirror replaces the previous
  editor, with live carets and selections from everyone in the document.
- **The Live plane** (`lait/session/1`) carries the transient view and a reliable
  signal lane on the same connection. Transient state is non-durable by
  construction — proved by running rather than by parsing — and the plane sends
  what is true now rather than everything that was ever true.
- **Presence decides who gets told.** "Who is here" used to mean "who has ever
  been here"; it now means what it says, and a revocation is something a live
  session can actually hear.
- **Range-attached comments.** `lait issues comment <ref> --at START..END`
  anchors a comment to a span of text, counted in Unicode scalars, and the
  browser draws where it is attached.
- **History names a person**, not the machine they were sitting at.

### Specs: what the work answers to

An Issue says what work is happening; a Spec says what that work is meant to
satisfy. They are separate durable truths, and neither is stored inside the
other's markdown. See `docs/SPECS.md`.

- **`lait issues spec`** — `new`, `revise`, `review`, `issue`, `withdraw`,
  `resolve`, `show`, `ls`, `history`, `links`. Kinds are `goal`, `requirement`,
  `plan`, `design`, `order`, `guide`, `proof`, `verdict`, `waiver`, `record`.
  Every state transition takes `--expect <revision>`, so two people moving the
  same head cannot both win.
- **Revisions are immutable with exact predecessors.** Concurrent successors stay
  visible as conflict heads; they are never resolved by last-writer-wins.
  Drafting a successor does not silently revoke its issued predecessor.
- **`lait issues baseline`** freezes a named, reviewed set of exact issued Spec
  revisions — the tracker's equivalent of an issued drawing set — and
  `baseline bind ENG-42 bas_…@<revision>` pins an Issue to one.
- **Packets.** `lait issues packet <ref>` derives the effective brief for one
  Issue: governing truth, guidance, proof, records, and unresolved conflicts. It
  is a projection, and the only supported way to answer "what governs this work
  now?" without reimplementing the graph rules.
- **The viewer draws all of it** — a project's Specs, the whole revision DAG, and
  everything that happens to a spec.

### Agents are members

- **`lait install-mcp --agent <name>`** lets a named client bring its own agent
  identity, so an agent's work is attributed to the agent rather than to the
  human who sponsored it. `--no-agent` opts out.
- **The plugin preflights the three things that stop the tools working**, and
  writes a config that outlives the shell that made it.
- **The MCP router serves the World tools.** A shell-only router was being served
  in its place, which hid the entire `issues_*` surface.

### The store keeps an index, not a page list

The paged manifest and inline catalog are replaced by authenticated radix
indexes over a journal that commits deltas. At 100,000 Bodies — the protocol
maximum — changing one Body's head went from rewriting and fsyncing a 28.8 MB
manifest to writing 177 bytes, and p50 commit latency went from 5.81 s to 206 ms.

- Catalogs reconcile by descent rather than by comparing roots.
- A causal contract in lait's own terms, with a bounded rollback.
- `lait rebuild` builds the current representation from the prior one, proves
  logical equivalence, and activates the complete result atomically. Old bytes
  are left inactive rather than destructively rewritten or taught to every future
  reader.
- A Manifest root that declares content refs it cannot back is now refused. No
  peer in the field is affected — nothing produced a content declaration before
  this release, which is exactly why the rule lands now.

`docs/COMPATIBILITY.md` is new and collects every versioned surface, what gates
it, and what a bump costs.

### Fixes

- **Joining works.** The hub demuxed Contact's first frame as an Offer rather than
  as the opening it actually sends, so joins died silently; and a finished
  doorbell pump read as a dead Station, making a joiner rebuild its host dozens of
  times per join. Both were join-fatal.
- **A refusal can be heard.** Where an unreadable ledger used to answer, it now
  refuses, and a poisoned lock says so once instead of repeatedly.
- **The admission lock is no longer held across the refusal write.**
- **A failed batch restores every Body it touched**, and the store keeps what it
  holds rather than what it has ever done.
- **The resident cache cannot half-exist, fail open, or scan itself.**
- **The revision that governs is the one counted**, and the row index stops
  ringing the doorbell.
- **The type check no longer creates the roots it asks about.**
- **The doorbell pump's backoff arithmetic is explicit.**

### Under the hood

- **A testing architecture, written down** (`docs/TESTING.md`): T0 laws
  (properties over generated op programs), T1 contracts (golden files), T2
  behaviour, T3 simulation (a seed replays a whole multi-peer schedule), T4
  reality (real relays, nightly). Tiering the suite stopped the PR path paying
  for all of it, and one test binary per package replaced roughly seventy.
- **The whole stack replays from a seed**, with a controllable clock and a MemNet
  that finally has the controllable delivery it always promised.
- **Coverage-guided fuzzing for the pre-auth decoders**, with a seed corpus so a
  nightly finding stays found.
- **Lint policy is consolidated into `[workspace.lints]`**, with the clippy
  pedantic and nursery groups curated by name, and the panic-shaped lints denied
  outside tests.
- **Substrate failure types are semantic and owner-qualified** — a semantic
  rejection and a host failure are no longer the same type.
- `crates/relay` joins the workspace; `world-bridge` is gone.

### The daily loop moves house

- **`lait issues …` is the tracker.** `ls`, `board`, `new`, `edit`, `comment`,
  `label`, `assign`, `move`, `milestone`, `cycle`, `activity`, `attachment` and
  the rest are mounted from the Issues package's own CLI. `lait` itself keeps
  what belongs to a Space — `init`, `join`, `invite`, `members`, `status`,
  `serve`, `update`, and the ceremonies.
- **The shell refuses collisions rather than resolving them.** A World client
  package cannot claim a namespace a shell command already uses; the check runs
  at construction, so a package that would shadow `join` fails loudly instead of
  quietly winning.
- **MCP tools are namespaced the same way**, so an agent's tool list reads as the
  same shape as the CLI.

### Milestones you can steer

- **Manual order.** `lait issues milestone edit <project> <milestone> --top`,
  `--bottom`, `--before <other>`, `--after <other>`. Order is a fractional rank
  on each record, so moving one milestone writes one record — two people
  reordering at once cannot lose each other's work, and the reader breaks ties on
  the milestone id so every replica agrees.
- **A prose body.** `--description` on `milestone new` and `milestone edit`;
  absent leaves it alone, `""` clears it.
- **A filter.** `lait issues ls --project ENG --milestone "Beta"`. A milestone
  belongs to exactly one project, so the filter is refused without a project to
  resolve the name against rather than guessed at.
- **A rail that scopes.** The viewer's project rail draws each milestone's state
  from its live counts and scopes the issue surfaces on click, with the
  No-milestone bucket kept distinct from no filter at all.

### The viewer reads like Linear

- **In-place editing on every issue surface**, with every row field predicted
  optimistically and the write living on the store rather than the component.
- **The issue as a document** — a standing reply composer, comment cards, event
  glyphs, and history narrated as sentences instead of a field-diff dump.
- **The project overview becomes a project shell**, with tabs over one scope.
- **Light mode climbs like dark** — grey canvas, white cards — and colour is
  generated from the design axes rather than authored per component. Radius,
  control height, icon and mark sizing each got one vocabulary and one pinned
  axis, so a new control inherits its geometry instead of picking one.
- **Inter Variable for text, Roboto Mono for code.**

### Fixes

- **The doorbell says what moved, not merely that something did** — dependencies
  match by project id, so a rename cannot silently detach a panel from its data,
  and a Contact no longer collapses several semantic changes into one ring or
  drops authority news on the way through.
- **Issue rows share one key column**, sized in `ch`, so keys of different widths
  stop ragging the list.
- **Packaging manifests and release metadata point at `nixiesoftware`**, and the
  workspace crates are marked `publish = false` — they are internal, and the
  release no longer tries to publish what cannot be published.
- **Release verification docs named the wrong file**: `sha256.sum` covers
  `source.tar.gz`, not the platform archives, which carry their own `.sha256`.

### Under the hood

The tracker is now two packages — `products/issues` (the semantic World: schemas,
DTOs, identifiers) and `products/issues-app` (its CLI, MCP, protocol, router,
presentation) — reached through a product-neutral call boundary. The daemon hosts
Stations in-process behind an orbit control router, transport endpoints are shared
by device identity rather than per Space, and `lait` is an orbital navigation
shell that mounts World client packages. None of this is visible from the outside
except as the namespace move above.

## v0.6.0 — one word for one thing

> **A naming flag day, a clean break, and the release where the tracker became a
> product.** The thing lait organises work in is a
> **space** — the CLI has said so since v0.5.0, and now the code, the on-disk state,
> and the wire say it too. `lait-engine` is now **`lait-fabric`**, and `UserId` is now
> **`DeviceId`**. Nothing is migrated: **founders must re-init, everyone else must
> re-join from a fresh invite.** Your `ws_…` ids and the `--workspace` / `workspaces`
> aliases still work — the ids in the wild keep working, and your fingers keep working.
>
> ```
> lait update            # everywhere
> lait init              # founders — nothing from v0.5.x is migrated
> lait join <link>       # everyone else, from a fresh invite
> ```

### One word for one thing

- **`lait-engine` is `lait-fabric`.** The kernel determines **legitimacy** — identity,
  authority, custody, recovery, and which transitions are valid given signed history.
  The fabric maintains the **shared world** — documents, persistence, history,
  convergence, projection. They are separate crates because the dependency edge is a
  correctness boundary: convergence cannot confer legitimacy. They ship, test, and
  version together as lait's substrate. "Engine" also collided with the CRDT engine
  the crate seals; prose that said "the engine" now says Loro, the fabric, or the
  daemon, whichever it meant.
- **"Workspace" is gone from the code.** `WorkspaceId` → `SpaceId`, `WorkspaceTicket`
  → `SpaceTicket`, `WorkspaceKey` → `SpaceKey`, `workspaces.json` → `spaces.json`, and
  the Loro identity key `workspaceId` → `spaceId`. v0.5.0's note that "internal
  identifiers and architecture docs keep 'workspace'" is superseded. **The `ws_` id
  prefix is unchanged**, and `--workspace` / `lait workspaces` / `recover-workspace`
  remain as aliases.
- **`UserId` is `DeviceId`.** A peer *is* its ed25519 key; `ActorId` is the person.
  This changes no bytes — the type is a newtype over a string in every encoding — only
  what the code calls itself. `PeerId` stays as the transport-layer alias. The CLI and
  MCP noun `<userref>` is now `<who>`, matching the control-plane field it feeds.

### The break

- **Schema v3, sync protocol v3, control protocol v6**, plus `lait/sync/2`,
  `lait/presence/2`, and gossip topic epoch `v3`. Old and new nodes cannot see each
  other at all: ALPN negotiation fails before a frame is exchanged, and the gossip
  topic differs.
- **Control routes name both local Orbit and expected Space.** Two local
  participations in the same Space remain independently addressable, and a stale
  or confused route fails before it reaches Mechanics, Station, or a WorldHost.
- **One identity-scoped Lait daemon supervises every local Orbit.** Opening thirty
  Spaces does not start thirty always-on World processes; Stations are placed on
  demand and share the identity transport hub.
- **Product commands are namespaced by their World package.** Issue-tracker CLI
  commands live under `lait issues ...`, and its MCP tools use the `issues_*`
  prefix. The root `lait` interface navigates identities, Orbits, Spaces, and
  installed Worlds.
- **Web product calls use an explicit World route.** Generic Space control and
  package-owned request schemas no longer share a deserialize-fallback namespace.
- **v0.5.x stores are refused, not migrated.** The schema gate now has a lower bound
  as well as an upper one; opening an older store names the version and points at
  `lait init` / `lait join` rather than opening it and projecting it as spaceless.
- **A running v0.5.x daemon is replaced, not talked to.** It reads as behind the
  control-protocol window, so the first client contact kills and respawns it.
- **`workspaces.json` is not read.** The space registry is `spaces.json`; it is
  navigation state and rebuilds itself on the next `init`, `join`, or daemon open.
- **Invite links carry a version, and pre-v0.6 links are refused by it.** An older
  invite now fails with "that invite is from an older lait" and a pointer at `lait
  invite`, instead of decoding into plausible-looking fields — postcard is not
  self-describing, so a stale link had no way to announce itself. The link is
  otherwise the same length it always was: a host is still 32 raw bytes on the wire,
  because the identity did not change even though its name did.

### The web client

`lait serve` is a real client now, not a viewer over the control plane.

- **One shell.** A persistent header, a project tree in the sidebar, and one
  breadcrumb grammar on every surface. Board, calendar and timeline are *layouts*
  of Issues rather than sibling destinations, and there is one navigation verb
  behind all of them.
- **An issue body is a document.** 15px prose on a capped measure, spacing by
  adjacency rather than a flat gap, tables, GitHub-style callouts, anchored
  headings, and fenced code coloured by Shiki from a lazily-loaded grammar. The
  colours resolve through the app's own theme tokens, so a theme switch needs no
  re-highlight.
- **The body compiles as you type.** Milkdown, chosen over Tiptap and Lexical
  because its document is parsed and serialized by remark: descriptions are plain
  CRDT text that `lait show` prints verbatim, and an editor that normalised on
  save would rewrite an agent's issue the moment a human touched one word. Two
  known deviations are documented and tested rather than hidden.
- **Settings, filters, bulk, search.** A space rename, a labels page, a workflow
  editor, roles and access; a wide filter popover; range selection; saved,
  scoped display state and a durable density preference.

### The tracker grew up

- Comments have identity, threads and reactions. Issues have due dates, estimates,
  followers, milestones, cycles, initiatives, teams, triage, templates and
  attachments. Projects have an overview, a lead, planned dates, an updates feed,
  and can be archived or deleted.
- Deletion is a signed, reversible authority op, and the trash is a destination
  rather than an appendix.

### Agents are members

- A sponsored member is a member: same grants, same surfaces, no `agent-*` verbs.
  The daemon is multi-tenant, so agents act as themselves in one store instead of
  borrowing a human's identity.

### Authority and ceremonies

- Scheme-neutral authority vocabulary and proposals; authority grants are ordinary
  signed nodes; a canonical `SigningPlan` with any-K threshold signing; DKG
  transcripts bound to the proposals that authorised them.
- Revoke wins over a concurrent invite redemption, behind a causal rekey fence.
  Detached message signatures are domain-separated and space-bound.

### The network seam

- iroh is sealed behind `lait-net` and the daemon drives the network through a
  transport seam, so the protocol names no concrete transport type. The legacy
  architecture is deleted rather than deprecated.

### Convergence

- Multi-writer bodies converge on constituent heads with name-identified
  containers. Contact transfers are O(changed) via signed holdings declarations.
  The beacon substrate makes steady-state sync live — a write reaches a peer
  without a re-join.
## v0.5.2 — the board works, history is durable, and issues have a shape

v0.5.0 put a board in the browser but left it read-rich and write-poor: you could
look at it, not work it. This release closes that, and lands two engine features on
top — a per-issue history that survives restarts and attributes every change, and an
issue graph (sub-issues, links, blockers) that could not exist before.

> **One flag day, but no re-init.** Sync protocol v1 is retired: a v0.5.2 node
> **refuses to sync with a v0.5.1-or-older node**, with a clear "the peer must
> upgrade lait" message rather than a silent divergence. This is deliberate — the new
> content-authority ops (below) would split E2EE if an old node silently dropped what
> it couldn't decode. So **every node in a workspace must `lait update` to v0.5.2**;
> do it and they sync again. Unlike v0.5.0, **nothing is re-initialized** — your
> stores, invites, and history all carry forward, and this is designed to be the
> *last* flag day of its kind.
>
> ```
> lait update      # on every node in the workspace
> ```

### The web client runs the daily loop

The browser could render the board; now it can drive it. Assign and unassign, add and
remove labels, `start` / `done` / `stop`, drag a card across columns (or move it by
keyboard), switch and create projects, filter by status — all with the same keymap the
terminal taught (`a` `b` `p` `s` `m`, `S`/`D`/`O`, `J`/`K`). Rows and cards show
assignee avatars instead of a "you +1" string. Every one of these verbs already
existed in the engine; the browser simply couldn't reach them.

### A history you can trust, and a shape for issues

- **Durable, attributed history.** Each issue's timeline is now read from its change
  log on disk, so it **survives daemon restarts** and names **who** made each change —
  a teammate's edit included, because the author travels with the op. (It replaces a
  per-session ring that forgot everything on restart and could only ever say "a peer
  changed this.")
- **The issue graph.** Issues now have **sub-issues** (a parent/child tree),
  **links** (`blocks` / `relates` / `duplicates`), and a computed set of **open
  blockers**. Sub-issues use a tree-move CRDT, so two people reparenting concurrently
  can never produce a cycle. The web surfaces all of it as a navigable Relations
  panel; creating edges from the browser lands next.

### Content authority and agents (CRAIT)

Membership and catalog structure are now carried by a **signed-DAG envelope** whose
authority is content-addressed and verifiable. Human members can **sponsor agent
keypairs**, and there is a **membership audit log** whose author is cryptographically
verified — the one feed in lait that isn't advisory — surfaced in the web Members
view, an unauthorized op shown rather than hidden.

### Contributor tooling

`npm run dev` is now one command: it starts the engine, reads its token, and wires the
dev proxy — no second terminal, no copy-paste. `lait serve --json` prints
`{url, token, port}` for scripting, and `cargo build` now picks up a rebuilt web
bundle on its own (the `touch src/serve/shell.rs` ritual is gone). A new
`viewer/README.md` documents the whole loop.

## v0.5.1 — `lait update` actually updates

`lait update` has never worked on Windows. It always failed with `specified file
not found in archive`, because the path it asked self_update to pull out of the
release zip was `lait.exe.exe`: self_update appends the platform's executable
suffix to `bin_name` *before* expanding `{{ bin }}`, so the template spelled
`.exe` a second time. v0.4.8 shipped that as a *fix* for this exact symptom, and
v0.5.0 carried it forward.

- **The path is checked against the release, not against itself.** The in-archive
  path is a claim about cargo-dist's layout, and the test only compared that claim
  to our own code — it asserted the template string verbatim, so it restated the
  bug rather than catching it. A new CI job downloads the archives users actually
  download and asserts the path self_update would extract is really inside them.
- **Every platform's path is now computable from any host.** It was behind
  `#[cfg(windows)]`, which can only ever be exercised on the platform it selects —
  which is why the Windows arm went unexercised through two releases. It takes the
  target as an argument and reads `self_update::get_target()`, the same string
  self_update substitutes, so what we plan and what it does cannot drift apart.

> **Updating from v0.5.0 or earlier on Windows needs one manual step**, since the
> broken code is in the binary doing the updating. Re-run the installer once and
> `lait update` works from then on:
>
> ```
> powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -c "irm https://github.com/Nixie-Tech-LLC/lait/releases/latest/download/lait-installer.ps1 | iex"
> ```

## v0.5.0 — the browser is the interactive surface

The 0.4.x line was a chat engine wearing an issue tracker's clothes. This one is
the tracker: `lait serve` puts a keyboard-first board in a browser over the same
control plane the CLI already spoke, the re-architecture pulls the last chat-era
assumptions out at the root, and the daily loop — `lait` → `start` → work →
`done` — finally reads like the thing you actually do.

> **Two breaks, both needing action.** Stores, invite tickets, and the wire all
> changed: **every node must re-init (founders) or re-join from a fresh invite
> (everyone else)**; nothing is migrated. And **`lait tui` is gone** — `lait serve`
> replaces it. Both are detailed below.

### The browser is the interactive surface; the TUI is gone

**Breaking: `lait tui` no longer exists.** `lait serve` replaces it — a keyboard-first
board in a browser, over the same Layer-B control plane. Also removed: the `tui.theme`,
`tui.tabs`, and `tui.key.<action-id>` config keys. Nothing else about the CLI, the
daemon, or the wire changed.

- **`lait serve` — the control plane over loopback HTTP + SSE.** The engine's contract
  has always been `control.rs`, but every client so far was a local process that could
  speak a named pipe; a browser cannot. This is the one adapter that closes the gap —
  the same `Request`/`Response`, the same `Doorbell` stream, re-bound to a socket a
  browser can reach. The engine grew a port, not a UI. See `docs/UI.md`.
- **The first surface that is global to the machine.** The control channel is keyed by
  home, so there is one daemon per space; a spaces picker means holding N. Listing only
  probes (opening the browser never wakes every daemon you have registered) — selecting
  a space is what attaches it.
- **Your agents are visible.** Agent spaces appear in the picker, tagged, so you can
  watch what they are doing. They are read-only there: a write through an agent's daemon
  would be signed *as* that agent. Write through your own space and sign as yourself.
- **Loopback auth, because the socket was the authentication.** `control.rs` never
  needed auth — a Unix socket is gated by file permissions, a named pipe by its DACL, so
  opening the channel *was* the credential. An HTTP port inherits none of that and adds a
  caller that never existed: the pages you visit. So: loopback-only bind, a per-run
  token, and a strict `Host`/`Origin` allowlist. The last is the load-bearing one — after
  a DNS rebind the browser believes the attacker is us and hands over the cookie, so the
  token stops being a secret; `Host` is the field they cannot launder.
- **Destructive verbs keep the CLI's question.** `confirm_destructive` refuses under
  `--json` because a pipe cannot be asked. A browser can, so the question comes back and
  the UI asks it — using `cli::destructive_question`'s own words, so the modal and the
  terminal cannot disagree about what is dangerous.
- **The client has one seam.** One vocabulary (`Command`), one door (`contribute`).
  Keys, the palette, and the `?` overlay are projections of one registry, never second
  lists. The core registers its own commands through that same door, so an extension can
  do anything the core can — and override anything the core gets wrong.
- **What the TUI left behind.** Its architecture outlived it: `UI.md` §4 (the doorbell
  stream, the correlation-free optimistic overlay) is still the contract, and `lait serve`
  implements it. Its keyboard design — one action vocabulary with stable ids, bindings as
  data with every listing a projection, a palette derived from the live `cmdspec` tree —
  is the web client's spine. `ratatui`/`crossterm` stay for the inline `lait members`
  picker, which was never part of the TUI; only `tui-textarea` left the tree.

### CLI ergonomics: ask before doing, and say what actually went wrong

Additive within epoch 1 — no flag day. The new `hello` handshake and the
`Candidates.near_miss_for` field both decode on clients that predate them.

- **The control channel has a version.** `CONTROL_PROTOCOL_VERSION`, exchanged in a
  `hello` handshake, completes the set the previous release started: the sync plane
  had `PROTOCOL_VERSION` and the store had `SCHEMA_VERSION`, but the CLI↔daemon
  channel had nothing — so a client meeting a daemon of another vintage found out by
  failing to decode its answer. That read as "no daemon", spawned a doomed second one
  over the held lock, and blamed a timeout 20s later. The reply is read as raw JSON
  *before* any typed decoding, so a mismatched daemon can say that it is mismatched
  without the answer depending on the schema that changed. A daemon that does not know
  `hello` identifies itself by rejecting it (v0.4.8 and earlier).
- **Upgrading no longer strands you.** `lait update` announced "stopped the running
  daemon" on any *decodable* reply — including an error, and including the "shutting
  down" a pre-`signal_shutdown` daemon sends and then ignores. It now verifies the
  process is actually gone. This was the bug that *delivered* the stale daemon that
  then couldn't be diagnosed.
- **A daemon this build can't talk to is now offered up for repair** rather than
  reported as a timeout: detected in ~0.02s (was 20.4s), named, and — with your
  consent — stopped and replaced, verifying it really stopped rather than trusting its
  acknowledgement. Never for a daemon *newer* than this build: replacing it downgrades
  the node, and a store written at a newer `SCHEMA_VERSION` would then refuse to open.
  There the answer is `lait update`. A spawned daemon that dies now fails fast with its
  own words (kept in `daemon.log`) instead of a 20s timeout.
- **lait asks before destroying** (`delete`, `members remove`, `members rotate-key`),
  and `-y/--yes` is the way through. `delete` names the issue's **title**: its ref comes
  from the git branch when omitted, so a stale checkout could tombstone the wrong issue
  with nothing on screen to notice it by. With no TTY (CI, an agent, a pipe) or under
  `--json`, nothing ever prompts — it fails naming `--yes`. See UI.md §2.4.
- **Errors report in one voice.** `main` returning `Result` handed every client-side
  failure to anyhow's `Termination`: a capitalised `Error:` beside the daemon path's
  lowercase `error:`, a `Caused by:` chain that leaked `data-encoding` and `postcard`
  internals ("non-zero trailing bits at 3") to anyone who pasted an invite badly,
  `--json` ignored (prose on stderr, *nothing* on stdout — indistinguishable from an
  empty result), and exit `1` for everything, including the not-founds UI.md §2.3
  documents as `2`. All four are fixed at one reporter; exit codes now derive from the
  error's type, never its prose.
- **Bad invites explain themselves** in terms of the invite, not our encoding.
- **"Did you mean" on a ref that matched nothing** — the candidate machinery already
  existed for ambiguous refs; typos are the more common way to get there. Suggestions
  only when a guess is defensible.
- **`--help` separates global flags from each command's own**, under `Global Options`.
- **A captured command on Windows no longer hangs forever.** `CreateProcess` inherits
  *every* inheritable handle, not just the three in `STARTUPINFO`, so the daemon a
  command auto-spawns came up holding a write-end of that command's stdout — its own
  `Stdio::null()` notwithstanding. The command exited, the pipe never closed, and
  anything reading to EOF (`$(lait new …)`, a test harness, an MCP client) waited on an
  EOF that could not arrive. The daemon is now spawned through `CreateProcessW` with a
  `PROC_THREAD_ATTRIBUTE_HANDLE_LIST` naming the only three handles it may inherit, so
  it comes up holding what we handed it and nothing else — including nothing we
  inherited from *our* parent and never knew we had. lait also clears
  `HANDLE_FLAG_INHERIT` on its own stdio at startup, which bounds the same leak through
  the children spawned without that ceremony (a `hook`, the notification balloon);
  children given stdio explicitly still inherit it, as std duplicates the handle for
  them. Unix was never affected — those fds are `CLOSE_ON_EXEC` — and Windows now
  matches it exactly: nextest reports the suite leak-free on all three OSes.

### Protocol version negotiation, schema gate & release hardening

Composes with the workspace re-architecture break below — the same epoch-1 wire
change (`lait/sync/1`, `lait/presence/1`, workspace-id gossip topic) — adding
in-band version negotiation on top of it.

- **In-band version negotiation.** The sync handshake now carries a
  `protocol_version`; a peer outside the supported window
  `[MIN_SUPPORTED_PROTOCOL, PROTOCOL_VERSION]` is refused with a clear "upgrade
  lait" diagnostic instead of a silent decode failure. Undecodable gossip
  payloads (the other version-skew path) are logged at debug rather than dropped
  silently. From here on this window absorbs backward-compatible changes without
  another ALPN bump.
- **On-disk schema gate.** Opening a workspace store written by a *newer* lait now
  fails fast with an upgrade message rather than risking a lossy read
  (`SCHEMA_VERSION` is finally enforced on load).
- **`lait update` heals a dev-channel node.** A `dev` build now reports a
  clean-semver `X.Y.Z-dev.<sha>` to the updater (which sorts below stable), so
  `lait update` moves it onto the stable release instead of reporting "already up
  to date" and stranding it.
- **Distribution fixes.** `cargo binstall lait` now resolves the binary correctly
  on Linux/macOS (the archive nests under `lait-<target>/`; only Windows is flat).
  The MSRV CI gate actually tests 1.91 again (it was silently running on stable).
  Releases now ship a build-provenance attestation and a CycloneDX SBOM, and the
  build was migrated to a custom-artifacts architecture so binaries can be signed
  in place (macOS notarization + Windows Azure signing land next). See
  `docs/RELEASES.md`.

### The daily-loop DX pass (spaces, start/done/stop, inbox)

Shaped by a blind design exercise (Linear-style and Jira-style teams designing
this CLI from the same capability spec): both independently reinvented our
explicit-create + registry architecture, and exposed the gaps this pass closes.

- **`spaces`.** The user-facing noun is now *space*: `lait spaces [ls|forget|prune]`
  (`workspaces` kept as an alias), global `-w/--space` selector, all messages
  reworded. Internal identifiers and architecture docs keep "workspace".
- **Work-state verbs.** `lait start [ref]` = assign yourself + first
  active-category status + create/checkout `key-n-slug` (one commit = one
  activity row; `--no-branch` to skip; branch step silently skipped outside
  git). `lait done` / `lait stop` close the loop — refs infer from the branch,
  so the daily cycle is `lait` → `start` → work → `done` with no ref typed.
  `new --start` files and claims in one line. The daemon off-switch is renamed
  **`shutdown`** (`stop` the word belongs to the work loop).
- **A durable inbox.** `lait inbox [--clear]`: remote assignments, comments on
  your work, `@nick` mentions, and status moves on your issues — derived at
  sync-import time (attribution-honest: comments carry their real author,
  everything else renders actor-unknown rather than guessing), persisted to
  `inbox.json` with a read watermark, so unread items survive daemon restarts.
  Sits beside `activity` (the workspace firehose). TUI shows an unread badge.
- **Bare `lait` is your focus** — unread inbox summary + your open issues —
  instead of help.
- **Fewer nouns.** Labels are created on first use (`-l perf` just works;
  removals still error on unknown). Project creation is key-first:
  `projects add OPS ["Operations"]` (name defaults to the key; `new` aliased).
  Help is bucketed: the first screen leads with the daily loop; registries and
  node plumbing sink to the bottom. Empty outputs always name the next command.
- MCP gains `issue_start` / `issue_done` / `issue_stop` / `inbox` tools — an
  agent works an issue exactly like a human (claim → comment → done).

### Workspace & project re-architecture (BREAKING)

> **Clean break.** Stores, invite tickets, and the wire protocol all changed;
> old and new nodes cannot see each other (new gossip topics + ALPN bumps
> `lait/sync/1`, `lait/presence/1`). **Every node must re-init (founders) or
> re-join from a fresh invite (everyone else).** Pre-rewrite `.lait/` stores and
> tickets are not migrated.

Five early decisions were removed at the root instead of guarded (see
`ARCHITECTURE.md` §15 and `GUIDED-JOIN.md`):

- **Workspaces are founded explicitly.** `lait init [--name]` is the founding
  verb: it mints the genesis here, names the workspace (default: the directory),
  and **seeds a first project** so `lait new` works on the very next command.
  Nothing creates a store implicitly anymore — a command in a directory with no
  workspace errors with guidance instead of silently minting a decoy store (the
  old lazy mint created a genesis + sealed key as a side effect of `lait ls` in
  the wrong folder).
- **The gossip topic derives from the workspace id.** The chat-era "room" string
  (folder-seeded, drift-prone, three self-heal layers) is gone; the display name
  is a synced, cosmetic catalog field — renaming never re-topics and never
  invalidates tickets. `profile.json` is retired. Tickets are now
  `WorkspaceTicket { workspace, name, host, host_nick, invite }`; old tickets
  fail to parse with an "ask for a fresh one" hint.
- **`lait join` bootstraps the store client-side** (cwd or `--dir`) from the
  ticket before the daemon ever runs, so a daemon only opens a store already
  bound to the right workspace. Joining from a directory bound to a *different*
  workspace is a hard exit-2 error — the old silent adopt-if-empty /
  split-brain-if-not heuristic is deleted. `remote add` with a foreign-workspace
  ticket now errors ("join it first").
- **`lait workspaces` is complete and live.** The registry is written by
  `init`, `join`, and every daemon open — founders finally register. Rows carry
  name, origin (founded/joined), advisory project keys, and `ls` probes live
  status (`up`/`idle`/`missing`); `forget` deregisters, `prune` drops missing
  entries. A new global **`-w <name|ws_id|path>`** selector targets any
  registered workspace from any directory.
- **`lait config`** — git-style layered local settings: global + per-store
  `config.json`, store wins. Keys: `user.nick` (set applies live to a running
  daemon via a new `ConfigReload` request — never a silent wait-for-restart) and
  `project.default`; the `workspace.*` namespace is reserved for future synced
  settings. `lait init`'s old settings-editor role (and the `--room` footgun
  that silently re-topiced a live workspace) is gone.
- **Project defaulting that matches how you work.** `new`/`board` resolve their
  project through a fixed chain: explicit `-p` → the git branch's project key
  (`eng-142-fix` → `ENG`, used only if it resolves) → `project.default` →
  the sole project → a teaching error. `board`'s positional is now optional;
  `ls -p` stays a pure filter; `move -p` stays explicit-only. Project keys are
  validated (1–8 ASCII letters) so `KEY-n` aliases and branch inference stay
  parseable.

## v0.4.8 — Windows self-update fix

- **`lait update` works on Windows again.** cargo-dist ships the binary **flat**
  at the root of the Windows `.zip` (`lait.exe`) but **nested** under a
  `lait-<target-triple>/` directory in the unix `.tar.gz` archives; the updater
  assumed the nested layout everywhere, so every Windows self-update failed at
  extraction with `specified file not found in archive`. The in-archive path is
  now chosen per-OS (with a unit test pinning the contract). **Note:** the broken
  updater is baked into the running binary, so a Windows node on ≤ v0.4.7 must
  reinstall once via its installer (`scoop update lait`, `winget upgrade lait`,
  or the `install.ps1` one-liner) to land a fixed binary; `lait update` then
  works in place from v0.4.8 on.

## v0.4.7 — guided-join onboarding & instant-at-scale edits

- **Guided-join onboarding that names the one thing that's wrong.** A first
  invite silently passes ~10 gates (right directory, daemon up, membership
  sealed, a peer reachable, catalog converged) that otherwise all fail as the
  same empty board. A new verifier projects live daemon state into an ordered
  gate list (workspace / daemon / membership / peer / synced) and names the
  single actionable blocker, identically on every surface: `lait doctor` (alias
  `verify`) — run automatically as a tail on `lait join`, which also flags a
  store/workspace mismatch; an MCP `doctor` tool; and a TUI Doctor panel (`d`)
  with a joined-workspace selector (`w`). Gates are founder-aware: an admin, or
  an already-synced member, with no peers online isn't blocked.
- **The directory trap is closed.** Running commands from the wrong directory no
  longer auto-creates a decoy `.lait/` store: a join records `store path ->
  workspace` in a `workspaces.json` registry, and read-only commands (including
  `tui`) refuse to conjure an empty store when you've already joined a workspace
  — pointing you back at the real one instead.
- **Edits stay instant with thousands of issues.** Two edit-path costs that grew
  with issue count are gone. The alias/handle table is now maintained
  incrementally — O(log N) per change instead of an O(N²) rebuild on every edit
  and sync — and git snapshots are coalesced onto a periodic checkpoint off the
  mutation path instead of a `git add -A` per keystroke (durability is
  unchanged: every write is still fsync'd). In a 2,000-issue workspace, per-edit
  work dropped ~13x and the on-disk store shrank ~30x.

## v0.4.6 — one-step invites & self-updater fix

- **A default invite admits the joiner automatically — no `members approve`.**
  `lait invite` now embeds a **signed, single-use pass** in the ticket (Pattern A):
  the joiner runs `lait join <link>` once and transitions `pending → member` on
  its own, the board decrypting as the workspace key is sealed to it. This
  collapses the old two-humans round-trip (`invite → join → members requests →
  members approve`) into `invite → join`. The seal still happens key-side on an
  admin node that holds the workspace key, so **E2EE is unchanged**: a
  non-member/removed node still sees only ciphertext.
- **The pass is a bearer capability, bounded and revocable-by-design.** Authority
  rides the channel the link travels over, capped by an expiry (`--ttl-hours`,
  default 168 = 7 days) and, by default, a single redemption. A synced,
  admin-signed replay guard (a nonce recorded in the membership doc) burns a
  single-use pass atomically with the member add, so it can't seat a second
  joiner. A pass signed by a non-admin, expired, foreign-workspace, or
  already-spent is silently ignored — the join falls back to a pending request a
  human can still `members approve`.
- **Opt back into the gated flow, or widen the pass.** `lait invite
  --require-approval` mints a pass-less ticket (the classic `members
  requests`/`members approve` flow, preserved unchanged); `--reusable` admits a
  whole team until expiry instead of one person. `invite` output and the post-join
  `status` message now state which mode is in effect.
- Wire note: `RoomTicket` and the gossip `JoinRequest` gained an optional invite
  field — a coordinated format bump (nodes should run the same version).
- **`lait update` now extracts the binary from cargo-dist archives.** The native
  in-place updater looked for a bare `lait` at the archive root, but release
  tarballs nest the binary under a `lait-<target-triple>/` directory, so every
  update failed with `Could not find the required path in the archive: "lait"`.
  The updater now points at `lait-{{ target }}/{{ bin }}`, matching the layout
  produced by cargo-dist on every platform. **Note:** binaries built before this
  fix (≤ v0.4.5) can't self-heal — upgrade once via your installer (`brew upgrade
  lait`, `install.sh`, etc.); subsequent `lait update` calls then work.

## v0.4.5 — invite & remote ergonomics

- **User-refs resolve by local alias and id-prefix.** `<userref>` now accepts a
  key id-prefix (≥4 hex) or a **local alias** (petname) in addition to `@me` / a
  full 64-hex key, resolved daemon-side against a directory of known keys (members
  + live presence + recent join requests). Names come only from your private alias
  store — a self-asserted wire nick is **never** a resolution input, so it can't
  select a key at a trust boundary. Ambiguity returns a candidate list (UI.md
  §3.2). Applies to `members add/remove`, `assign`, and `new -a`.
- **Local petnames (identity, git-style).** The strong identity is the ed25519 key
  (what the signed ACL is keyed on); a friendly name is a **local alias** you
  attach to a key, stored in `aliases.json`, never broadcast, never part of the
  ACL. Set one with `lait members alias <key|prefix> <name>`, or inline while
  adding/approving via `--as <name>`. `members ls` shows the alias next to each
  key. (MCP: `member_alias`, plus `alias` on `member_add`/`member_approve`.)
- **Join-request approval (key-first).** `lait members requests` lists people who
  ran `connect`/`join` but aren't members yet, showing the **authenticated short
  key** and the joiner's nick only as an unverified *claim*. `lait members approve
  <prefix|key> [--as <name>]` seals them the workspace key — resolving strictly by
  key (confirm the short id out-of-band; an unauthenticated nick must never select
  who gets the key). The joiner's short key is also shown on `lait log` join lines.
  Both surface as MCP tools (`member_requests`, `member_approve`).
- **`remote` alias for `seed`.** `lait remote add/ls/rm` is a git-like alias of the
  seed registry. `seed ls` / `remote ls` now emit a structured DTO (id, nick,
  workspace, state, online) so `--json` is scriptable.
- **`lait invite` papercuts.** `invite` now always renders a scannable terminal QR
  of the invite link (suppressed under `--json` so scripts stay parseable).
  Clipboard copy works on Windows (`clip`, with a PowerShell fallback). `--email
  <addr>` opens your OS mail client with a prefilled invite (mailto — no SMTP, no
  credentials).

## v0.4.4 — crates.io + winget publishing

- **All channels live.** Adds automated **crates.io** publishing
  (`publish-crates.yml`, same `workflow_run` trigger — `cargo install lait` +
  docs.rs) and enables **winget** submission. With Homebrew, Scoop, `cargo
  binstall`, and the GitHub Release, a single version tag now publishes to every
  supported channel automatically.

## v0.4.3 — fully automatic release publishing

- **One release run publishes everywhere.** The Homebrew, Scoop, and winget
  publishers are now cargo-dist **custom publish jobs** (`publish-jobs` →
  reusable `workflow_call` workflows), invoked by the release run itself after it
  hosts the release. No more manual `workflow_dispatch` after each tag — pushing a
  version tag builds, releases, and pushes to the tap + bucket end to end. Each job
  still mints its own short-lived token from the org GitHub App and soft-skips if
  its credentials are absent.

## v0.4.2 — distribution: one command on every platform

- **GitHub is the canonical home.** Removed the GitLab CI + `homepage` split-brain
  (Cargo.toml + the Claude plugin now point at `github.com/Nixie-Tech-LLC/lait`);
  local node state (`.lait/`, `.groupchat/`) is gitignored.
- **Every install path works.** `cargo install`, `cargo binstall` (prebuilt, no
  compile), Homebrew (`brew install nixie-tech-llc/tap/lait`), Scoop, winget, a
  Docker image for an always-on **seed node**, and `lait completions <shell>` /
  `lait man` generated from the CLI itself. New `docs/INSTALL.md` covers the matrix.
- **Distribution CD.** On each release, the Homebrew formula and Scoop manifest are
  published automatically using a short-lived token minted from the org GitHub App
  (no long-lived PAT); a CI job structurally validates the Scoop + winget manifests.
- Hardened tests for the new stateless CLI surfaces (`tests/cli_surfaces.rs`).

## v0.4.1 — native in-place updater

- **Native in-place updater.** `lait update` now self-updates in-process from the
  latest GitHub release — no external `lait-update` companion binary. It stops a
  running daemon first (so the swap isn't blocked by a held file handle on
  Windows), then downloads this platform's release asset and atomically replaces
  the running executable. Pure-Rust throughout (`ureq` + rustls for HTTP,
  gzip/zip extraction, atomic self-replace), consistent with the no-C-deps ethos.
  Unix release archives switch from `.tar.xz` to `.tar.gz` so extraction needs no
  liblzma; the cargo-dist external updater is no longer shipped (`install-updater
  = false`).

## v0.4.0 — renamed `groupchat` → `lait`

Project rename. The binary, library, package, MCP server, and all identifiers are
now `lait`. This is a **clean break** (pre-1.0): env vars are `LAIT_*` (was
`GROUPCHAT_*`), the per-repo store directory is `.lait/` (was `.groupchat/`), the
config/identity root moves accordingly, the invite link scheme is `lait://join/`,
and the wire ALPNs + crypto domain-separation tags are re-tagged under `lait/…`.
A `lait` node therefore does not interoperate with a `groupchat` node, and an
existing `.groupchat/` store is not adopted — re-found the workspace from a fresh
`lait` invite. The GitHub repository moved to `Nixie-Tech-LLC/lait` (old URLs
redirect).

## v0.3.2 — durability & sync-liveness hardening

Follow-up hardening from a durability audit of the local-first / iroh
distribution layer (tracked as the `DUR` project inside groupchat itself):

- **Crash- and power-loss-durable local writes (DUR-2).** `write_atomic` now
  `fsync`s the temp file before the rename and `fsync`s the parent directory
  after it (unix), closing the rename-without-`fsync` window where an already-
  acked write could be lost on power loss. Atomicity is unchanged; a no-op on
  Windows, where `MoveFileEx` durability is handled by the filesystem.
- **Restart reconnection (DUR-1).** The daemon persists the peers it has met
  (`peers.json`, written when the mesh forms) and seeds gossip bootstrap from
  them on start, so a restarted node actively rejoins the mesh instead of waiting
  to be re-announced to. Verified end-to-end: a node killed mid-workspace
  restarts and reconverges to changes made while it was down.
- **Stay online to serve sync (DUR-3).** A daemon that has ever meshed with a
  peer no longer idle-shuts-down, so its changes stay pullable; only a solo,
  never-meshed node (auto-spawned for a one-off command) still idles out.
- **Always-on seed (DUR-4).** `groupchat daemon --seed` runs a node that never
  idles — once added to the workspace with `members add`, it holds full history
  and serves offline-to-offline handoff and GC-boundary backfill.
- **Pinned seed peers — the P2P "remote".** `groupchat seed add <ticket|id>`,
  `seed ls`, `seed rm` pin an always-on seed your node always dials and eagerly
  backfills from on startup, so a cold or long-offline client converges through
  its seed even when no ordinary peer is online. Pins grant no trust (genesis/ACL
  still gate every op).
- **Repo-bound stores (DUR-5).** The workspace store is discovered git-style:
  `groupchat` walks up from the cwd for a `.groupchat/` and binds it, else auto-
  creates one in the cwd — so each repo gets its own workspace, daemon, and room
  (defaulted to the repo directory name). Identity is now **global** (one
  `secret.key` under the config dir) so one identity spans every repo, like a
  single `git` `user.email`. `$GROUPCHAT_HOME` still collapses both into one
  self-contained dir; a `.gitignore` is dropped in each store so it is never
  committed. (Windows: the extended-length `\\?\` prefix is now stripped from
  resolved store paths, which several Windows tools/APIs choke on.)
- **In-place updates — `groupchat update`.** Runs the bundled cargo-dist
  self-updater (`groupchat-update`) from one entry point, stopping a running
  daemon first so the binary can be swapped (notably on Windows, where a live
  daemon holds a lock on the exe). Falls back to clear guidance when the updater
  isn't installed (e.g. a `cargo install` build).

Still open (tracked in `DUR`): the blind encrypted relay — a ciphertext-only,
untrusted-host seed (DUR-6).

## v0.3.0 — the P2P, E2EE issue tracker (release candidate)

groupchat becomes a working **local-first, peer-to-peer, end-to-end-encrypted
issue tracker** — a decentralized, rapid-feedback alternative to Linear that runs
as a native Rust node, built on [iroh](https://www.iroh.computer/) (P2P QUIC) and
[Loro](https://loro.dev/) CRDTs over a git-backed durable store. Verified
multi-node over real iroh on Linux, macOS, and Windows.

### Highlights

- **A fast, standalone tracker (P0).** Create / edit / move / assign / label /
  comment / close issues from a CLI, a full-screen [ratatui](https://ratatui.rs)
  TUI, or an MCP agent — all driving one daemon that owns the Loro documents.
  Boards and lists render from a catalog cache (no per-issue loads); issues carry
  a short git-style `iss_` handle plus a friendly `ENG-142` alias. The TUI stays
  live off a doorbell event stream and echoes edits optimistically.
- **Live P2P sync (P1).** Catalog-first sync over a custom iroh ALPN: two nodes
  converge in ~2s with no central server. A portable **seed** role — any headless
  node advertised in a ticket — backfills a cold client from nothing but the
  ticket. Three-state presence (online / away / offline).
- **End-to-end encryption + membership (P3).** Workspace data is E2EE, gated by a
  **signed ed25519 ACL op-graph** (add / remove / roles, deterministic replay,
  remove-wins). The workspace key is distributed via X25519 sealed boxes and
  **rotated on removal** (lazy revocation); a non-member — or a removed member —
  sees only ciphertext. `members add/remove/rotate-key/ls` on the CLI, MCP, and a
  TUI members view. Pure-Rust crypto (RustCrypto/dalek) — no C toolchain, no
  `aws-lc`.
- **Agent-native (MCP).** The full tracker surface is exposed as MCP tools that
  return the same versioned DTO the CLI `--json` emits; a build-gate parity test
  keeps the human and agent surfaces in lock-step.

### Cross-platform & release

- Builds and runs on **Linux, macOS, and Windows**; the hardened CI gate (build +
  test with `-D warnings`, fmt, clippy, doctests, MSRV 1.91, `cargo-deny`,
  portability guard, DTO/MCP parity, a per-OS end-to-end smoke, and a release
  dry-run) covers all three. The gate reproduces green on Windows and Linux
  (the latter incl. real-iroh multi-host convergence); the earlier macOS smoke
  regression (a broken-pipe panic) is fixed.
- Release binaries for macOS (arm64 + x86), Linux (arm64 + x86), and **Windows
  (x64)** are produced by the cargo-dist pipeline on a version tag, with shell +
  PowerShell installers, per-target self-updater, and SHA-256 checksums. The
  Windows and Linux binaries have been built and run natively; the macOS targets
  build via the release pipeline.

### Validation & fixes (this candidate)

An independent validation pass (adversarial security + CRDT review, real
multi-host P2P on separate Linux hosts, and scaling measurement) hardened the
candidate:

- **Revocation is now sound.** The signed-ACL op signature binds its causal
  `parents` and the workspace id, closing a bypass where an evicted member could
  re-parent an admin's still-valid `AddMember` op past their removal. ACL replay
  is also fully deterministic (Kahn topological sort), so every node computes the
  same membership and seals each epoch key to the same set.
- **Issue bodies sync across real networks.** A connection-teardown race that
  truncated the trailing document frames (only catalog rows converged, bodies
  stayed provisional) is fixed; a cross-node body-sync assertion guards it.
- **Piping CLI output no longer panics** (`groupchat board | head`).

Install (once released):

```sh
# macOS / Linux
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -LsSf https://github.com/Nixie-Tech-LLC/groupchat/releases/download/v0.3.0/groupchat-installer.sh | sh
# Windows (PowerShell)
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -c "irm https://github.com/Nixie-Tech-LLC/groupchat/releases/download/v0.3.0/groupchat-installer.ps1 | iex"
```

Upgrade in place with `groupchat-update`.

### Known limitations (accepted / deferred)

- The E2EE layer implements a proven *design* by hand and is **research-grade**:
  unaudited, and it needs independent review before carrying truly sensitive data.
- Lazy revocation only (no clawback of already-synced data); metadata (sizes,
  timing) is visible to a relay; all members of a workspace read all its issues.
- The blind-relay **ciphertext-chunk sedimentree** compaction (P2) is designed but
  its GC is deferred — encrypted sync already makes the seed a blind relay.
- Deferred: RIBLT scale escape-hatch, account-aggregates-devices identity, and a
  CGKA (BeeKEM) key-agreement upgrade over the current sealed-box distribution.
- **Write throughput is not yet optimized.** Each issue create/edit rewrites the
  whole catalog snapshot, rebuilds the alias table, and makes a git commit, so
  bulk authoring is super-linear in workspace size (per-issue interactive latency
  is fine at hundreds of issues, noticeable at thousands). Board/list reads and
  cold-load remain catalog-only. Incremental persistence (append `export(updates)`
  + batched commits) is the planned fix.
- **Catalog-first sync assumes bidirectional gossip.** The changed-doc set is
  derived from the LWW-merged catalog head; under strictly one-directional
  connectivity a puller whose own head write out-ranks the provider's can defer a
  fetch until a reverse pull re-stamps it. It self-heals under the normal
  gossip-both-ways mode; deriving the changed set from the catalog op-diff is the
  planned hardening.

Foundation preserved from the earlier chat-oriented releases: the iroh endpoint +
ed25519 identity, signed-gossip room, presence, daemon + cross-platform control
channel, CLI, and MCP plumbing.
